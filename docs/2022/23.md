## Problem Intro

Phew.  This one was significantly less traumatic than yesterday!!

We need to plant seedlings in a grove. We're given a map that shows elf positions (marked `#`) and empty ground (marked `.`) We need to direct elves to the appropriate positions.

The input data looks something like this:

```text
....#..
..###.#
#...#.#
.#...##
#.###..
##.#.##
.#..#..
```

Rounds: elves alternative between considering where to move to, and actually moving. The rules are:
- Consideration step:
  - Consider all 8 adjacent positions for each elf.
  - If no elves in those positions, do nothing in this round.
  - Otherwise, propose moving the elf a step in the first valid direction, from a list of directions.
  - If there's more than one elf proposed to a position, none of these elves move.
- Move step: move the elves to their proposed locatiosn.
- Finally, rotate the list of directions (and associated rules).

## Part 1

**Simulate the Elves' process and find the smallest rectangle that contains the Elves after 10 rounds. How many empty ground tiles does that rectangle contain?**

Here's my strategy:
- Create a `Point` class for our `(x,y)` positions. This `Point` class knows how to:
  - Add vectors to create new points.  
  - We'll use this to obtain the `set` of _ALL_ adjacent points (_neighbours_) for each location.
  - And we'll add another utility method which will only return the adjacent points from a list of directions supplied.
- Create an [Enum class](/python/enumerate#enum) to store our 8 vectors, i.e. N, NE, E, SE, etc. This allows us to store all the vectors as a collection of related constants.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    """ Point x,y which knows how to add another point, 
    and how to return all adjacent points, including diagonals. """
    x: int
    y: int

    def all_neighbours(self) -> set[Point]:
        """ Return all adjacent orthogonal (not diagonal) Points """
        return {(self + vector.value) for vector in list(Vector)}
    
    def get_neighbours(self, directions: list[Vector]) -> set[Point]:
        return {(self + vector.value) for vector in list(directions)}
        
    def __add__(self, other) -> Point:
        """ Subtract other point from this point, returning new point vector """
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"P({self.x},{self.y})"

class Vector(Enum):
    """ Enumeration of 8 directions, and a rotating list of direction choices. """
    N = Point(0, -1)
    NE = Point(1, -1)
    E = Point(1, 0)
    SE = Point(1, 1)
    S = Point(0, 1)
    SW = Point(-1, 1)
    W = Point(-1, 0)
    NW = Point(-1, -1)
```

Now create a `Grid` class, which is created from the grid of initial elf positions:

```python
class Grid():
    """ Stores a set of all elf positions. """
    def __init__(self, grid: list[str]) -> None:
        self._grid = grid
        self._elves: set[Point] = set()
        self._initialise_elves()
        
        self._directions = deque([ # use a deque so we can rotate
            ([Vector.N, Vector.NE, Vector.NW], Vector.N),
            ([Vector.S, Vector.SE, Vector.SW], Vector.S),
            ([Vector.W, Vector.NW, Vector.SW], Vector.W),
            ([Vector.E, Vector.NE, Vector.SE], Vector.E)
        ])

    def _initialise_elves(self):
        """ From input, store all current elves - marked with '#' - as a set.
        Then define the bounds. """
        for y, row in enumerate(self._grid):
            for x, val in enumerate(row):
                if val == "#":
                    self._elves.add(Point(x, y))
        self._set_bounds()

    def _set_bounds(self):
        self._min_x = min(point.x for point in self._elves)
        self._max_x = max(point.x for point in self._elves)
        self._min_y = min(point.y for point in self._elves)
        self._max_y = max(point.y for point in self._elves)
    
    def iterate(self) -> int:
        """ Perform a single iteration by following the rules.
        Returns: the number of elves that moved. """
        proposals: dict = {} # E.g. {elf point: proposed point}
        for elf_locn in self._elves: # for every existing elf location
            
            # check if this elf has any immediate neighbours
            if elf_locn.all_neighbours().isdisjoint(self._elves):
                proposals[elf_locn] = None
                continue # no neighbours are elves; this elf does nothing
            
            for direction_checks, proposed_direction in self._directions:
                if elf_locn.get_neighbours(direction_checks).isdisjoint(self._elves):
                    proposals[elf_locn] = elf_locn + proposed_direction.value
                    break # exit at the first matching direction

            if proposal is not None:

    def _rotate_direction(self):

        self._directions.rotate(-1)
        
    def score(self) -> int:

        total_tiles = (self._max_x+1-self._min_x) * (self._max_y+1 - self._min_y)
        elf_count = len(self._elves)
        
        return total_tiles - elf_count
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        lines = []
        for y in range(self._min_y, self._max_y+1):
            line = ""
            for x in range (self._min_x, self._max_x+1):
                line += "#" if Point(x,y) in self._elves else "."
                    
            lines.append(line)
            
        return "\n".join(lines)
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Grid(score={self.score})"
```

Here's what it does:

  - Stores elf positions as a `set`, and initialise the bounds, i.e. the minimum and maximum
    `x` and `y` values of all our elves.
  - Stores our `_directions` as a [deque](/python/lifo_fifo), where each member is a `tuple` of:
    - The `list` of three adjacent locations we need to check
    - The direction the elf should move, if there are no elves in that `list`.
  - Provides a method to _rotate_ this `deque`, i.e. so that the next direction is the new first choice. (And the previous preferred choice is now the last preferred choice.)
  - Provides a `score()` method, which returns the number of empty tiles within the bounds.
    It does this by calculating the area of the _bound rectangle_ (using the bounds we calculated earlier), and then subtracting the count of all the elves in our set. 
    The difference is the number of empty locations in the ever-expanding rectangle.
  - The `iterate()` method does all the hard work.
    - Create an empty `dict` to store a proposed elf location for each current elf.
    - For each elf, get all its neighbours. Check if the `set` of neighbours is a _disjoint_ with the `set` of all existing elf locations.  Recall that `isdisjoint()` only returns `True` if there is no overlap between the two sets. If this is the case, then this elf will not move.
    - Next, iterate through the `_directions` `deque` in order.
      - Check each of the three adjacent locations in the current direction check, 
        and if there are no elves in any of those locations, propose the specified new direction.
    - Now we need to check if there are any proposed locations that are common to more than one elf.
      To do this:
      - Create a [defaultdict(list)](/python/defaultdict) called `elves_per_proposal`, that stores a `list` of current elf locations as the _value_, and the proposed location as the _key_.  Because this is `defaultdict(list)`, it will create an empty list for every location key it sees for the first time.  
      - And then, for every elf that is proposed to this location, we simply add the current elf.
      - Then, we iterate over this `defaultdicrt`, and wherever the `list` _value_ has exactly one member, we know that this target location has been uniquely proposed. In which case,
      remove the current position from `_elves` and add the new proposed position to `_elves`.
      - Wherever the list length is not `1`, we do nothing.
    - From here, create dict of {candidate locn: [elf1, elf2, ...]}
    - Finally, the method returns the number of elves that moved.  (We'll use this in Part 2.)

Now we can solve Part 1 by calling our `grid.iterate()` 10 times:

```python
def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read().splitlines()
        
    grid = Grid(data)
    
    # Part 1
    current_round = 1
    for _ in range(10):
        grid.iterate()
        current_round += 1
    
    print(f"Part 1: score={grid.score()}")
```

## Part 2

**Figure out where the Elves need to go. What is the number of the first round where no Elf moves?**

Now we simply need to iterate until the elves don't move any more.  This is trivial to achieve, since our `iterate()` method already returns the count of the number of elves that moved in the last iteration.  So we just need to iterate until this returns `0`.

```python
    while grid.iterate() > 0:
        current_round += 1
    
    print(f"Part 2: Stable at round {current_round}")
```

It could be a bit quicker, I guess!  Maybe I'll optimise it sometime.
