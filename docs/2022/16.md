## Problem Intro

Well, this sucked.

So, we find ourselves in the cave system of a volcano, which contains pipes connected by valves, as well as a bunch of elephants.  Standard.

Valves are connected to other valves by tunnels. Each valve starts closed.  Opening a valve releases pressure at a specific flow rate, given in units of _pressure per minute_.  We start at valve `AA` and it takes 1 minute to move from any valve to any adjacent valve.

Our input data looks something like this:

```
Valve AA has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves DD, II, BB
Valve BB has flow rate=13; tunnels lead to valves CC, AA
Valve CC has flow rate=2; tunnels lead to valves DD, BB
Valve DD has flow rate=20; tunnels lead to valves CC, AA, EE
Valve EE has flow rate=3; tunnels lead to valves FF, DD
Valve FF has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves EE, GG
Valve GG has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves FF, HH
Valve HH has flow rate=22; tunnel leads to valve GG
Valve II has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves AA, JJ
Valve JJ has flow rate=21; tunnel leads to valve II
```

## Part 1

**Work out the optimum steps to take, in order to release the most pressure in 30 minutes. What is the most pressure you can release?**

I spent a fair bit of time trying to solve this with an A* algorithm before I gave up. After reading a couple of hints on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/){:target="_blank"}, I settled for a memoization solution. I last used memoization when solving the [2021 Day 21 Dirac Dice problem](/2021/21).  It's not something I tend to go for automatically, because I find it quite confusing.  It's basically recursion, but caching any states we've seen before.  Thus, if our recursion ever finds a state we've seen before, we can immediately return and avoid wasted recursion.

Our network of valves and tunnels can be represented using a graph of nodes and edges.
