## Problem Intro

In today's puzzle, we're told that the volcano is erupting and lava droplets are falling into a pond.  We're examining the surface area of a lava droplet.  Our input data is a set of `x,y,z` coordinates the represent `1x1x1` cubes that make up the lava droplet.  The data looks like this:

```text
2,2,2
1,2,2
3,2,2
2,1,2
2,3,2
2,2,1
2,2,3
2,2,4
2,2,6
```

## Part 1

**What is the surface area of your scanned lava droplet?**

We need to count the cube faces that are _not_ connected to any other cubes.

My strategy:
- Create a `Cube` class that stores the `x,y,z` coordinate of a given cube in the droplet. The `Cube` can return coordinates of any adjacent cubes that our connected to our cube's faces; i.e. excluding any "diagonals".
- Create a `Droplet` class that stores all the cubes of our droplet and knows how to return the total surface area of the cubes it contains.

Here's the `Cube` class:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Cube():
    """ Cube with three dimensions and knows how to return Cube locations at adjacent faces. """
    x: int
    y: int
    z: int

    # To generate deltas only for faces, we need two of three dims to be 0
    ADJ_DELTAS = [(dx,dy,dz) for dx in range(-1, 1+1)
                        for dy in range(-1, 1+1) 
                        for dz in range(-1, 1+1)
                        if (dx, dy, dz).count(0) == 2]
    
    def adjacent(self):
        return {Cube(self.x+dx, self.y+dy, self.z+dz) for dx, dy, dz in Cube.ADJ_DELTAS}
```

As usual, I'm using a [dataclass](/python/classes#dataclass) to remove the need for boilerplate code. The cool bit here is how the class determines all the locations of adjacent cubes. If we were to simply return all coordinates within 1 unit of our cube, we would end up with 27 new cubes, i.e. a 3x3x3 cube, containing our original cube in the middle.  But to return only cubes that are adjacent to a _face_ of our original cube, we only want cube locations where the two of the coordinates are the same as our original cube, and where the third coordinate is 1 away from our original cube. As you would expect, there are only 6 such cubes, since a cube only has 6 faces. I.e.

```python
ADJ_DELTAS = [(dx,dy,dz) for dx in range(-1, 1+1)
                    for dy in range(-1, 1+1) 
                    for dz in range(-1, 1+1)
                    if (dx, dy, dz).count(0) == 2]

print(len(ADJ_DELTAS))
print(ADJ_DELTAS)
```

Output:

```text
6
[(-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0)]
```

The `adjacent()` method simply takes these six coordinate deltas, and creates six new cubes from them. It returns these six cubes as a `set`.

Now we can read in our input data, which is trivial to do:

```python
def parse_cubes(data: list[str]) -> set[Cube]:
    cubes = set()
    for line in data:
        coords = tuple(map(int, line.split(",")))
        cubes.add(Cube(*coords))
    
    return cubes
```

For each row, I split at the comma to give us three numerical values.  I use `map()` to convert each of these values to an `int`.

Let's now look at the `Droplet` class:

```python
@dataclass
class Droplet():
    """ Droplet is a volume of 1x1x1 cubes """
    ADJACENT_FACES = 6
    filled_cubes: set[Cube]
    
    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        self._all_surface_area: int = 0  # surface area, internal+external
        self._calculate_values()
    
    @property
    def all_surface_area(self):
        return self._all_surface_area
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return (f"Droplet(filled_cubes={len(self.filled_cubes)})")
        
    def _calculate_values(self): 
        """ Determine total surface area of all filled positions """
        for filled_cube in self.filled_cubes:
            self._all_surface_area += Droplet.ADJACENT_FACES - len(self.filled_cubes & filled_cube.adjacent())
```

As you can see, this is pretty simple.  Note that this is once again a `dataclass`, and as a result, I don't want to override the `__init__()` method that `dataclass` provides for us.  Instead, I've overridden the `__post_init__()` method, which allows us to do some initialisation after the implicit `__init__()` has run. For Part 1, all we do here is call the `_calculate_values()` method. This method:

- Iterates through every _filled_ cube in the droplet. (I.e. our input data.)
- For each one, determine its adjacent cubes and return the [intersection](/python/sets) of these adjacent cubes with our `set` of filled cubes. Whenever this intersection occurs, this particular face has an adjacent cube and can't be counted towards the total surface area.  The total surface area for any given cube is 6, so we subtract the intersection count from 6 to give us the number of exposed faces for this cube.

That part was easy!

## Part 2

This part is not so easy!

Now we're told that our droplet contains one or more internal empty volumes that have no route to the surface of the droplet.  We're told that we need to _exclude_ the surface area of these internal volumes from our calculation.

**What is the exterior surface area of your scanned lava droplet?**

Here, we define _external surface area_ as any cube faces that are exposed to empty space that is not part of sealed internal volume.

The tricky part is how we determine if an "empty" cube (i.e. any location that is not part of our input data) has a path to the "outside" or not.

Here's my strategy:

- Find all adjacent cubes to our _filled" cubes. These are either:
    - Part of an _internal pocket_. If we [flood fill](/python/shortest_paths) a pocket, it will have a nearby boundary.
    - Part of path to the outside. If we [flood fill](/python/shortest_paths), we will eventually reach a cube beyond all the droplet bounds.
- To solve:
  - For each _filled_ cube, get its adjacent cubes.
  - Perform a [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](/python/shortest-paths#breadth-first-search-bfs) from each adacent, if the adjacent cube is empty space.
  - If the BFS only leads to filled cubes, then all paths are blocked, so this cube is internal.
  - If the BFS leads to cubes that our outside of our bounds, then this cube has a path to the outside. Thus, this cube counts as _external_.
  - Store all paths to cache the BFS.
  - Only increment the surface area count every time we find an adjacent location that has a path out, i.e. only for cubes that are external.

Here's our modified `Droplet` class:

```python
@dataclass
class Droplet():
    """ Droplet is a volume of 1x1x1 cubes """
    ADJACENT_FACES = 6
    filled_cubes: set[Cube]
    
    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        # Store max bounds, so we can tell if we've followed a path beyond the perimeter
        self._min_x = self._min_y = self._min_z = 0
        self._max_x = self._max_y = self._max_z = 0
        self._all_surface_area: int = 0  # surface area, internal+external

                    explored.add(neighbour)
                    
        return False
```

The implementation of the BFS is standard, and we've covered this before.  The only other thing worth noting here is how we define the _bounds_ that we use to determine if our BFS has reached "outside". To set these bounds, we simply measure the minimum and maximum values of each of `x`, `y`, and `z`, from our `set` of _filled_ cubes. If our BFS ever reaches a cube where any of the cube coordinates are beyond these boundaries, then we know we've reached "empty space" outside of the perimeter of our droplet.

## Visualisation

Finally, let's render an image of our droplet using Matplotlib. We just need to add this method to our `Droplet` class:

```python
    def vis(self):
        """ Render a visualisation of our droplet """

        axes = [self._max_x+1, self._max_y+1, self._max_z+1]  # set bounds

        grid = np.zeros(axes, dtype=np.int8)   # Initialise 3d grid to empty
        for point in self.filled_cubes:  # set our array to filled for all filled cubes
            grid[point.x, point.y, point.z] = 1
        
        facecolors = np.where(grid==1, 'red', 'black')
        
        # Plot figure
        fig = plt.figure()
        ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
        ax.voxels(grid, facecolors=facecolors, edgecolors="grey", alpha=0.3)
        ax.set_aspect('equal')
        plt.axis("off")
        plt.show()
```

All we're doing here is:

- Generating a NumPy ndarray with the appropriate `x`, `y`, `z` bounds.
- Set all the values in the ndarray to 0 using `np.zeros`.
- For any location where we have a "filled" cube, set the value in the ndarray to 1.
- Set the colour to red for these filled cubes.
- Render the plot using **[voxels](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.html#mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.voxels){:target="_blank"}**, i.e. a built-in Matplotlib method for plotting 1x1x1 cubes.

And the image rendered looks like this:
