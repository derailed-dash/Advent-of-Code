## Problem Intro

We're told we have stacks of crates that we need to rearrange.

The input data looks something like this:

```text
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

I.e. the first part of the input data is the configuration of crates, and the second part is the instructions to move crates between stacks.

## Part 1

We're told our crate moving machine is able to move crates from the top of one stack, to the top of another stack.  It can only move one crate at a time.

**After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?**

This is a pretty simple exercise.  It's really just about popping items from a stack, and appending those items to a different stack.

If anything, parsing the original configuration is the toughest part!

First, I read the data and split it into two portions:

```python
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        stack_data, instructions = f.read().split("\n\n")
   
    stacks = process_stack_data(stack_data.splitlines())
    movements = read_instructions(instructions.splitlines())
```

Here's the code that parses the original stack configuration:

```python
def process_stack_data(stack_data: list[str]) -> list[list]:
    """ Data looks like... 
            [D]    
        [N] [C]    
        [Z] [M] [P]
         1   2   3
         
    Return: [['Z', 'N'], ['M', 'C', 'D'], ['P']]
    """
    stack_width = 4
    p = re.compile(r"[A-Z]")
    # reverse it, so we've got the stack numbers at the top
    stack_data = stack_data[::-1]
    num_stacks = len(stack_data[0].split())

    stacks = [[] for _ in range(num_stacks)] # empty list for each stack
        
    # proces the stacks
    for stack_row in stack_data[1:]:     # starting at the row of crates
        for stack_num in range(num_stacks):
            match = p.search(stack_row[stack_num * stack_width:(stack_num+1) * stack_width])
            if match:
                stacks[stack_num].append(match.group())
        
    return stacks
```

How does it work?

- First, we define `stack_width` to be 4, since this is the width of a string like `"[N] "`.
- Then we reverse the list that makes up our stack configuration, using the `[::-1]` construct.
  Thus, we now have our stack numbers at the top.
- Then we count how many stacks we have. I've done this by splitting all the stack numbers wherevre there is white space, and counting how many items are returned.
- Then, using [list comprehension](/python/comprehensions) I create a list of empty stacks, to hold the crates for each stack.
- Then we iterate through the remaining rows, starting at the first row of crate information.
  - For each row, we'll have data that looks something like `"[Z] [M] [P]"`.
  - We iterate through each stack, i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.
  - We multiply the current stack number by the `stack_width`, in order to create a slice of the current row that only contains a single crate.
  - Then we extract this single crate using some simple regex.
  - If we've found a crate, add it to the current stack.  If we haven't, then there's no crate in this position, for this stack.

Here's the code that reads the remaining data, i.e. the instructions:

```python
def read_instructions(instructions: list[str]) -> list[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """ Instructions look like: 'move 3 from 8 to 6' """
    p = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")
    movements = []
    for line in instructions:
        how_many, from_where, to_where = list(map(int, p.findall(line)[0]))
        from_where -= 1 # we need it to be 0-indexed
        to_where -= 1 # we need it to be 0-indexed
        movements.append((how_many, from_where, to_where))

    return movements
```

- The regex here is pretty simple and doesn't really need any explanation.
- We've also converted all of the digits we've read into `int`, using `map()`.
- Since Python indexes lists starting with 0, but our stack numbers start with 1, 
  I'm reducing the `from_where` and `to_where` stack numbers by 1.
- Finally, we append the three numbers - i.e. `how_many`, `from_where`, `to_where` to the `movements` list, as a tuple.

Now we've parsed all the data, it's time to solve Part 1.  Here's my code:

```python
    # Part 1
    # make a copy, since we need to reset the stack for Part 2
    part1_stack = deepcopy(stacks)
    for how_many, from_where, to_where in movements:
        # pop items off the end, for how_many times
        for _ in range(how_many):
            part1_stack[to_where].append(part1_stack[from_where].pop())
    
    stack_message = "".join(a_stack[-1] for a_stack in part1_stack)
    print(f"Part 1: {stack_message}")
```

How does it work?

- We start by making a deep copy of the starting stack configuration.  I'm doing this, because we'll need the original stacks for Part 2 later.  So I don't want to mess with them here!
- Iterate over each instruction, and `pop` the last create off the end of the `from_where` stack, as many times as required. Each item we _pop_ is _appended_ to the `to_where` stack.

That's it!

Finally, we just need to print the value of the top item in each stack, which we can do using `a_stack[-1]` to reference the last item.  Also, I'm using list comprehension here to do this for every stack.  This returns a list, which I think convert to a `str` using the `join()` method.

## Part 2

We're told that our crate moving machine doesn't work quite how we thought!  This is the CrateMover 9001, and it moves multiple crates at a time.  It picks them up in a pile, and moves them to the target stack in the same order that they were lifted.

**After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?**

Here's my solution code:

```python
    # Part 2
    for how_many, from_where, to_where in movements:
        # slice items off the end and move to the target stack
        stacks[to_where].extend(stacks[from_where][-how_many:])
        stacks[from_where][-how_many:] = [] # and then delete the items
        
    stack_message = "".join(a_stack[-1] for a_stack in stacks)
    print(f"Part 2: {stack_message}")      
```

The only difference here is that rather than popping a crate off the end `n` times, I'm now slicing multiple crates off the end with each move.

- Note that I'm using `extend()` rather than `append()`, because a slice returns a new `list`. We want to add the _items_ from that new list, rather than the list itself.
- After a slice to get the crates at the end, I set that slice in the `from_where` stack to be empty. This is the technique I'm using to _remove_ those crates.

All done!

## Results

        for _ in range(how_many):
            part1_stack[to_where].append(part1_stack[from_where].pop())
    
    stack_message = "".join(a_stack[-1] for a_stack in part1_stack)
    print(f"Part 1: {stack_message}")
    
    # Part 2
    for how_many, from_where, to_where in movements:
        # slice items off the end and move to the target stack
        stacks[to_where].extend(stacks[from_where][-how_many:])
        stacks[from_where][-how_many:] = [] # and then delete the items
        
    stack_message = "".join(a_stack[-1] for a_stack in stacks)

    stack_width = 4
    p = re.compile(r"[A-Z]")
    # reverse it, so we've got the stack numbers at the top
    stack_data = stack_data[::-1]
    num_stacks = len(stack_data[0].split())

    stacks = []
    for stack_num in range(num_stacks):
        this_stack = []
        stacks.append(this_stack)

    return stacks

def read_instructions(instructions: list[str]) -> list[tuple[int, int, int]]:

    movements = []
    for line in instructions:

        from_where -= 1 # we need it to be 0-indexed

        movements.append((how_many, from_where, to_where))

    return movements

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    main()
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    print(f"Execution time: {t2 - t1:0.4f} seconds")
```

And the output looks like this:

```text
