## Problem Intro

Part 1 was pretty easy. Hurrah!  Part 2... Requires some more thinking!

We're told that if we solve the monkeys' riddle, they will show us a shortcut to the grove. The riddle is in the form of a set of instructions that look like this:

```text
root: pppw + sjmn
dbpl: 5
cczh: sllz + lgvd
zczc: 2
ptdq: humn - dvpt
dvpt: 3
lfqf: 4
humn: 5
ljgn: 2
sjmn: drzm * dbpl
sllz: 4
pppw: cczh / lfqf
lgvd: ljgn * ptdq
drzm: hmdt - zczc
hmdt: 32
```

The item before the `:` is the monkey name. Each monkey has one job.  The job is one of:
- Yell a number.
- Yell the result of a math operation.

The math operations are always one of `+`, `-`, `*` or `/`.

## Part 1

**What number will the monkey named _root_ yell?**

This is a recursive problem. We either know the numeric value the monkey needs to yell, or we need to recursively perform a math operation between two other monkeys.
