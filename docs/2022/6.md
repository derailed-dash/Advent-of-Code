## Problem Intro

Today's problem is pretty simple.  The logic is easy to understand, and it doesn't need much code at all.  This one took me under 5 minutes, which was nice!

So... We're given a stream of text, and we're asked to identify when the first sequence of unique characters appears.

The input data looks like a longer version of this...

```text
nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg
```

## Part 1

A _start-of-packet marker_ has been identified when the last four characters read are all different.

**How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?**

My strategy here is very simple...

- Let `distinct_chars_required` = 4
- Read in the data as a string.
- Process the data stream one character at a time and track the slice of the last `distinct_chars_required`
- Perform a count of all chars in `distinct_chars_required`. If they are all 1, then all the characters are different.

And that's it!

Here's where all the good stuff happens:

```python
def process_stream(data: str, distinct_char_sz: int) -> tuple:
    """ Process a str of data. 
    Report char position when the last distinct_char_sz chars are all different.

    Returns: tuple: (distinct_chars, position) """
    last_sz_chars = ""
    current_posn = 0
    
    stream = data[0:distinct_char_sz]
    for i, char in enumerate(data[distinct_char_sz:]):
        current_posn = i + distinct_char_sz
        last_sz_chars = data[current_posn-distinct_char_sz:current_posn]
        char_counts = Counter(last_sz_chars) # count chars in last four chars
        if all(count == 1 for count in char_counts.values()):
            break

        stream += char
    
    return (last_sz_chars, current_posn)
```

How does it work?

- First, we seed our `stream` with the first four characters from the input data.
- Then we [enumerate](/python/enumerate) over each character in the remaining data.
  - We store the `last_sz_chars` read, i.e. the last four characters.
  - We use the Python [Counter](https://realpython.com/python-counter/){:target="_blank"} class to create a `dictionary` that counts each character in our `last_sz_chars` string.
  - If the counts of every character in this string are all `1`, then they are all unique characters. And we're done!

## Part 2

A _start-of-message marker_ has been identified when the last 14 characters read are all different.

**How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?**

The solution here is identical to Part 1, except we now use a `distinct_char_sz` of 14, rather than 4.

## Results

The final code looks like this:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import time
from collections import Counter

SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
# INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/sample_input.txt")
INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/input.txt")

MARKER_SZ = 4
START_MSG_SZ = 14

def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read()
        
    distinct_chars, current_posn = process_stream(data, MARKER_SZ)
    print(f"Part 1: {distinct_chars} at {current_posn}")
    
    distinct_chars, current_posn = process_stream(data, START_MSG_SZ)
    print(f"Part 2: {distinct_chars} at {current_posn}")    

def process_stream(data: str, distinct_char_sz: int) -> tuple:
    """ Process a str of data. 
    Report char position when the last distinct_char_sz chars are all different.

    Returns: tuple: (distinct_chars, position) """
    last_sz_chars = ""
    current_posn = 0
    
    stream = data[0:distinct_char_sz]
    for i, char in enumerate(data[distinct_char_sz:]):
        current_posn = i + distinct_char_sz
        last_sz_chars = data[current_posn-distinct_char_sz:current_posn]
        char_counts = Counter(last_sz_chars) # count chars in last four chars
        if all(count == 1 for count in char_counts.values()):
            break

        stream += char
    
    return (last_sz_chars, current_posn)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    main()
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    print(f"Execution time: {t2 - t1:0.4f} seconds")
```

And the output looks like this:

```text
Part 1: lhtw at 1909
Part 2: hndbzfswtmvcpr at 3380
Execution time: 0.0101 seconds
```
