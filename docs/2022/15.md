## Problem Intro

Oh, no... Not [beacons and sensors again](2021/19){:target="_blank"}!

For me, this is the day that AoC 2022 **escalated**.  Up until this day, I was feeling reasonably smug about my ability to solve these challenges in the early hours before starting work.  I was thinking... _"I think I'm getting better at this!"_ 

And then today happened.  I spent quite a few hours on this one.

Okay, so the background...

We've deployed sensors to specific locations.  Each sensor detects the single beacon that it is closest to. Distance is measured in _Manhattan distance_, i.e. the absolute of the sum of the `x` and `y` components.

Our input data gives us the location of sensors and their respective beacons:

```text
Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
```

## Part 1

**In the row where y=2000000, how many positions CANNOT contain a beacon?**

Since each sensor is paired up with its _nearest_ beacon, each sensor is therefore surrounded by a "diamond" of locations that cannot possibly contain another beacon.

So what we need to do is find _all_ the diamonds that occupy any positions in row 2000000. These locations cannot contain beacons.

If the coordinates we were given were small, then this would be a perfect problem for some set algebra.  We could work out all the points for each sensor's coverage area, turn them into sets, and then use set algebra to get our answer.

Alas, the coordinates we're given are NOT small. For example:

```Sensor at x=2829808, y=2206448: closest beacon is at x=2930045, y=2000000```

The sets would just be too huge. So, the heart of my solution is to make use of intervals that represent the inclusive ranges in our row. Where we have overlapping intervals, we'll merge them.

Here's my solution strategy:

- Create a `Point` class which knows how to:
  - Add a vector to create a new point.
  - Determine Manhattan distance to another point.
- Read in input data, to create a `dictionary` that maps `Sensor -> ` nearest `beacon`.
- Create a `SensorGrid` class:
  - It store our `Sensor -> Beacon` `dictionary`.
  - `compress_intervals_for_row()` determines the horizontal slice of the diamond created by every
    sensor in range of this row. These horizontal slices are returned as a set of overlapping intervals.
  - Count all the `x` values that make up all of these intervals. These are not allowed.
  - Remove any `x` values that actually contain a beacon.

Now in a bit more details...

Here's the `Point` class:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    """ Point with x, y coords. Knows how to add a vector, remove a vector, 
    and calculate Manhattan distance to to another point. """
    x: int
    y: int
    
    def __sub__(self, other):
        """ Subtract other point from this point, returning new point vector """
        return Point(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)

    def __add__(self, other):
        """ Subtract other point from this point, returning new point vector """
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)        
    
    def manhattan_distance_to(self, other: Point) -> int:
        """ Manhattan distance between this Vector and another Vector """
        diff = self - other
        return sum((abs(diff.x), abs(diff.y)))
```

Note how this class overrides `__sub__()` and `__add__()` methods, such that we can use the `-` and `+` operators respectively.  E.g. `point_c = point_a + point_b`.

Here's how I read in the input:

```python
def process_sensors(data) -> dict[Point, Point]:
    # Find four digits, preceeded by "not digit"
    pattern = re.compile(r"[\D]+x=(-?\d+)[\D]+y=(-?\d+)[\D]+x=(-?\d+)[\D]+y=(-?\d+)")
    sensor_to_beacon: dict[Point,Point] = {}
    for line in data:
        sx, sy, bx, by = map(int, pattern.findall(line)[0])
        sensor_to_beacon[Point(sx, sy)] = Point(bx, by)
    
    return sensor_to_beacon
```

The main thing to note here is the use of _regex_.  The regex expression identifies four different capture groups.  I.e. groups surrounded by parentheses.  All the capture groups are the same: `(-?\d+)`. This means: capture at least one numeric digit, optionall preceeded by a `-`.

Each of these groups is returned as a `str`, so I'm using `map()` to convert them to `int` values. Finally, we can build our `dictionary`, where the key is the _sensor_ `Point`, and the value is the _beacon_ `Point`.

We can then create a `SensorGrid` object from this `dictionary`:

```python
class SensorGrid():
    """ Stores a grid of Sensors, and each sensor's nearest beacon. """
    
    def __init__(self, sensor_to_beacon: dict[Point, Point]) -> None:
        """ Takes a dictionary of Sensors and their beacons """
        self.sensor_to_beacon = sensor_to_beacon
        self.beacons = set(sensor_to_beacon.values())
        self.sensor_range = {s: b.manhattan_distance_to(s) 
                             for s, b in self.sensor_to_beacon.items()}
            
        self._init_bounds()

    def _init_bounds(self):
        """ Get the bounds by finding min and max values of any scanner or beacon,
        then adding to each edge the maximum distance we've found for any Scanner->Beacon """
        max_distance = max(self.sensor_range.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[1]    
        self.min_x = self.min_y = self.max_x = self.max_y = 0
        for s, b in self.sensor_to_beacon.items():
            self.min_x = min([self.min_x, s.x, b.x])
            self.max_x = max([self.max_x, s.x, b.x])
            self.min_y = min([self.min_y, s.y, b.y])
            self.max_y = max([self.max_y, s.y, b.y])

        self.min_x -= max_distance
        self.min_y -= max_distance
        self.max_y += max_distance
        self.max_x += max_distance

Things to say about this...

- The `__init__()` method:
  - Stores the `sensor_to_beacon` dictionary.
  - Stores a set of all the `beacons`.
  - Uses _dictionary comprehension_ to create a `dictionary` that maps each sensor to it's maximum _range_, by calculating the _Manhattan distance_ between the sensor and its beacon.
  - Determines the minimum and maximum bounds for both `x` and `y`. To achieve this, I've:
    - Determined the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` values across all the beacons and scanners.
    - Determined the maximum sensor range given all the sensor ranges.
    - Added this maximum sensor range to the min and max values we found previously.
- `_get_row_coverage_intervals()`:
  - First returns only the sensors that are within range of our target row.
    I.e. each sensor has a range, and so we only include sensors where the distance beween
    the sensor and our target row is less than or equal to the sensor's previously calculated range.
  - Then, for each sensor:
    - Determine the range for this sensor.
    - Determine how far away the row is from this sensor.
    - The difference between the range and distance to our row gives us the maximum possible
      `x` direction - either left or right - that this sensor can cover in our target row.
      This is how we determine the _horinzontal slice_ of the diamond. This is returned
      as an _interval_ that extends from the minimum value of x to the maximum value of x.
      Thus, each sensor gives gives us an interval in the form (start, end), representing a range on the row.
    - Take all the intervals, and merge them into the smallest number of non-overlapping intervals.
    - Add up ((end+1)-start) for each interval, 
      to find the total number of x locations where a beacon cannot be.
- `compress_intervals_for_row()` then takes the intervals created by `_get_row_coverage_intervals()`, and merges them, thus removing any overlaps.  I'm doing this using the algorithm described [here](/python/useful_algorithms){:target="_blank"}.
- Finally, I've included a `__str__()` method to print the sensors and beacons to the console. This is mainly to help us verify that everyting has been read and processed correctly. With the sample data, the output looks like this:

```text

................................................

```

Finally, we take every interval, subtract the beginning of the interval from the end, and then add up all the results. The result is the overlap of all intervals created by all the sensors. We then subtract any locations where a beacon is found.

```python
    grid = SensorGrid(process_sensors(data))

    # Part 1
    row_intervals = grid.compress_intervals_for_row(TARGET_ROW)
    coverage_count = sum(interval[1]-interval[0]+1 for interval in row_intervals)
    beacons_to_exclude = sum(1 for beacon in grid.beacons if beacon.y == TARGET_ROW)
    print(f"Part 1 - row {TARGET_ROW}: {coverage_count - beacons_to_exclude}")  
```

## Part 2

We're told that the distress beacon has not been detected by any of sensors. And we're told it must have `x` and `y` coordinates that are each no lower than `0` and no larger than `4000000`. Finally, we're told there will only be one valid position.

**Find the only possible position for the distress beacon. What is its tuning frequency?**

The _tuning frequency_ is given by multiplying its `x` coordinate by `4000000` and then adding its `y` coordinate.

My strategy:

- The distress beacon must be distance=1 outside an existing beacon.
- Iterate through each possible row. For each row:
  - Determine the intervals, like we did in Part 1.
  - Look for any gaps between the intervals. We're told that there will only be one valid location,
    so if we find a single 1-unit gap between coverage intervals, then this must be the `x` we're looking for.

Here's the code I added:

```python
    def test_points_outside_perimeter(self) -> Point:
        """ The signal beacon must be one outside of the perimeter of existing sensor boundaries. """
        for sensor_point, dist_to_nearest in self.sensor_range.items():
            for dx in range(dist_to_nearest+2): # max dx is dist_to_nearest + 1
                dy = (dist_to_nearest+1) - dx   # To always be on perimeter, dx+dy must be dist_to_nearest + 1
                
                for sign_x, sign_y in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]: # Add our dx and dy in all directions
                    x = sensor_point.x + (dx * sign_x)
                    y = sensor_point.y + (dy * sign_y)
                    
                    # Check within the bounds defined; if not, try next dx and dy
                    if not (DISTRESS_X_BOUNDS[0] <= x <= DISTRESS_X_BOUNDS[1]
                            and DISTRESS_Y_BOUNDS[0] <= y <= DISTRESS_Y_BOUNDS[1]):
                        continue

                    coverage = self.compress_intervals_for_row(y) # get all disallowed intervals
                    # look for a gap between any intervals
                    if len(coverage) > 1:
                        for i in range(1, len(coverage)+1):
                            if coverage[i][0] > coverage[0][1] + 1:
                                x = coverage[i][0] - 1
                                print(f"x must be {x}")
                                return Point(x,y)
        
        return None
    
    def tuning_frequency(self, point: Point) -> int:
        return point.x * TUNING_FREQ_MULTIPLIER + point.y
```

This solution runs in under 4 seconds, so it's fairly optimal.
