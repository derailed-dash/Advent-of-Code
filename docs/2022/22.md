## Problem Intro

Part 1 was okay.  Part 2 was horrendous.

We're given a strange map and told we have to navigate it by following a specific path. The map is composed of locations, which can be _empty_ or _tiles_.

- Tiles are valid locations on the map. 
  - Tiles can be `.`, which means this tile can be occoupied.
  - Alternatively, tiles can be `#`, meaning that this tile is blocked.
- Empty locations are represented by ` `, and these are NOT valid locations to visit.

Our input data is composed of two components: 
1. The map we must navigate.
1. A sequence of alternating numbers and letters:
   Number means: move forward `n` tiles; stop if you hit an obstacle.
   Letter means: turn left (`L`) or right (`R`), at current position. I.e. rotate left or right, relative to your current orientation.
   
Here is some sample input data:

```text
        ...#
        .#..
        #...
        ....
...#.......#
........#...
..#....#....
..........#.
        ...#....
        .....#..
        .#......
        ......#.

10R5L5R10L4R5L5
```
   
We're told that if we go off the map (well, more accurately, off the tiles), then we reappear at the tile on the opposite side. (Assuming not blocked.)

The final password is the sum of 1000 times the row, 4 times the column, and the last facing. Note that rows and columns are 1-indexed.  Facing values:
- 0 for right (>)
- 1 for down (v)
- 2 for left (<)
- 3 for up (^).

## Part 1

**What is the final password?**

Part 1 is easy enough. We need to:

- Split the input data into the its two components: the map and the instructions.
- We need a method to move us forward by a specified number of tiles.
  - But we stop if we reach a `#`.
  - And we wrap around to the opposite side if we reach the edge of the map, or an empty space.
- We need a method to rotate us left or right, by 90 degrees.

First, I create a `Point` class, as I often do!

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    """ Point class, which knows how to return a list of all adjacent coordinates """    
    x: int
    y: int
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        """ Subtract other point from this point, returning new point vector """
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    def neighbours(self) -> list[Point]:
        """ Return all adjacent orthogonal (not diagonal) Points """
        return [Point(self.x+dx, self.y+dy) for dx in range(-1, 2)
                                            for dy in range(-1, 2)
                                            if abs(dy) != abs(dx)]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"P({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

There's nothing new to say about this. As I often do, this `Point` class knows how to find the Points that make up its adjacent neighbours.

Now I read in the input data:

```python
def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        map_data, instructions = f.read().split("\n\n") # input is two blocks, separated by a line
        
    map_data = map_data.splitlines()
```

Now some vector stuff:

```python
DIRECTION_SYMBOLS = ['>', 'v', '<', '^']  # Orientation vector key
VECTOR_COORDS = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
VECTORS = [Point(*v) for v in VECTOR_COORDS] # so we can retrieve by index
```

- The `DIRECTION_SYMBOLS` is only used for rendering our map visually.
- The `VECTOR_COORDS` allows us to get our four direction vectors by index.  E.g. `VECTOR_COORDS[0]` gives us a vector of `(1, 0)`.
- `VECTORS` is a convenience `list` that allows us to retrieve any of these vectors in `Point` form.

Now I'll create a `Map` class to do all the hard work:

```python
class Map(): 
        
    def __init__(self, grid: list[str]) -> None:
        self._grid = grid # store original input grid
        
        self._height = len(self._grid) 
        self._width = max(len(line) for line in self._grid) # the widest line
        self._grid = self._pad_grid() # make all rows same length
        self._cols = self._generate_cols()
        
        self._staert = Point(0,0)
        self._posn = Point(0,0)
        self._direction = 0
        self._path = {}

        """ Create a list of str, where each str is a column.

        cols_list = list(zip(*self._grid))
        return ["".join(str(char) for char in col) for col in cols_list]
        
    def _set_start(self):
        """ Start position is first open space on the grid, 
        starting at (0, 0) - which could be in 'emtpy' space, and moving right. """
        first_space = self._grid[0].find(".")
        self._posn = Point(first_space, 0)
        self._start = self._posn
        self._direction = 0  # index of ['>', 'v', '<', '^']
        self._path = {self._posn: self._direction} # Everywhere we've been, including direction

    def _pad_grid(self):
        """ Make all rows are the same length. """
        return [line + " " * (self._width - len(line)) if len(line) < self._width else line for line in self._grid]
        
    @property
    def posn(self) -> Point:
        """ Point coordinate of the current position. """
        return self._posn
    
    def move(self, instruction: str):
        """ Can be direction instruction, i.e. L or R, or a move forward instruction, e.g. 10 """
        self._last_instruction = instruction
        if instruction.isdigit():
            self._move_forward(int(instruction))
        else:
            self._change_direction(instruction)
    
    def _change_direction(self, instruction):
        """ Rotate to the left or the right, relative to current orientation. """
        change = 1 if instruction == "R" else 3 # add 3 rather than -1, to avoid negative mod
        self._direction = (self._direction+change) % len(VECTORS)
        self._path[self._posn] = self._direction # update direction in the path

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Map(posn={self.posn}, last_instr={self._last_instruction}, score={self.score()})"
```

Things to say about this:
- The `Map` class is instantiated by passing in the grid from our input data.
- It determines the height and the width of the grid, at its widest points. Note that the input data may be missing trailing spaces on rows that have _empty_ space at the end.
- It pads out any short rows, so that all rows are the same length.
- It stores the start position, and sets it to the current position, i.e. `self._posn`. It also stores the current direction (as the `int` representation.
- It stores the path taken, which is a `dict` with key of `Point` and value of `direction`. Thus, it is a path made up of every point we've visited in the path, along with the direction we were last facing when we were at that point.
- The `move()` method handles the current instruction, which can be either a number (i.i.e. the number of spaces to move forward), or `L`/`R`.
- If the instruction is `L` or `R`, we call the `_change_direction()` method.
  - If we're turning right, we need to increment the direction vector by 1. (E.g. since 0 is right, then 1 is down.)
  - If we're turning to the left, we need to decrement the direction vector by 1.
  - However, we also want to wrap around, e.g. if we're at 3, we need the next direction to be 0.
  - The easiest way to achieve all the above is to add `1` for `R`, add `3` for `L`, and to _mod_ the result with `4`.
  - We then store the result as our current `_direction`.
- If the instruction is a number, we call the `_move_forward()` method.
  - Here, we call `_next_posn()` for each move we need to take. Each move gives us our next `candidate` position. This method adds one unit of the current direction vector to the current position. If, after adding the vector, we land on a tile, then this new position is viable. If not, then we need to wrap around.  To do that, I simply add a vector in the reverse direction, with a magnitude equal to the length of the row / column.
  - If the new candidate position is allowed (i.e. it is a `.`), we update `_posn`, and we add the position/direction to the `_path`.
  - If the candidate position is blocked (`#`), then we need to stop here.
- I've included a `score()` method, which returns the _final password_, as required by the problem.
- And lastly, I've added a `__str__()` method which renders the map to the console. Here I've added a bit of colour, to make it obvious where we started, and where we finished:

```python
class Colours(Enum):
    """ ANSI escape sequences for coloured console output """
    RED = "\033[31m"
    GREEN = "\033[32m"
    YELLOW = "\033[33m"
    BLUE = "\033[34m"
    MAGENTA = "\033[35m"
    CYAN = "\033[36m"
    BOLD = "\033[1m"
    RESET = "\033[0m"
```

So now, I'm ready to solve Part 1:

```python
def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        map_data, instructions = f.read().split("\n\n") # input is two blocks, separated by a line
                
    map_data = map_data.splitlines()
    
    the_map = Map(map_data)
    process_instructions(instructions, the_map)
    print(the_map)
    print(f"Part 1: score={the_map.score()}")

def process_instructions(instructions, the_map):
    next_transition = 0
    this_instr = "" 
    for i, char in enumerate(instructions):
        if i < next_transition:
            continue
        if char.isdigit():
            for j, later_char in enumerate(instructions[i:len(instructions)], i):
                if not later_char.isdigit():
                    next_transition = j
                    this_instr = instructions[i: next_transition]
                    break
                else:   # we've reached the end
                    this_instr = instructions[i]    
        else:   # we're processing alphabetical characters
            this_instr = instructions[i]

        the_map.move(this_instr)
```

How I handle in the instructions line is interesting. Basically, I enumerate the line so that each iteration of the outer loop returns a character, along with the index position of that character.

- If the current character is a digit, then this instruction is a number, and the number could have any length. So process subsequent chracters until the character is no longer a digit.  This gives us our _transition_ index, i.e. where we transition back to a `L` or a `R`. Then just grab all the characters between the first digit, and the transition. This gives us the number for our current move.
- If the current character is not a digit, then it must be `L` or `R`, and this instruction is only one character long.

After running this for the sample data, this is what I see:

![Navigating Tiles, Part 1]({{"/assets/images/navigating_tiles_pt1.png" | relative_url }})

## Part 2

Oh dear. The map actually represents an unfolded cube.  You can divide the map into 6 square _faces_. Any part of the map that is empty is not part of the foldable cube. With the sample data, the cube faces can be shown as follows:

```text
        1111
        1111
        1111
        1111
222233334444
222233334444
222233334444
222233334444
        55556666
        55556666
        55556666
        55556666
```

Now we're told that instead of wrapping between left and right, or between top and bottom, if we now get to the edge of any tiles, we need to wrap around as though this were a folded cube. Other than that, the problem is the same.

**Fold the map into a cube, then follow the path given in the monkeys' notes. What is the final password?**

For me, the first thing I needed to do was visualise the problem.  Here's my attempt to do this with the sample data:

![Cube Folding, Sample]({{"/assets/images/cube_folding_sample.png" | relative_url }})

I've added a coordinate system, so that we can locate each numbered face by simple coordinates. The coordinates can be expressed as follows:

```python
[(2,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] # Faces 0-5
```

I've also added coloured arrows that represent matching edges of folded faces. With this information, we can determine that (for example):

- If I leave the map facing up from face `0`, then I'm leaving at edge `a`. So I'll reappear on the map in face `1`, but I'll be travelling _downwards_.  
- Why? Because the `a` arrow for face `1` is at 180 degrees, relative to the `a` arrow for face `0`. And consequently, if I was travelling up when I left face `0`, then I must be now facing down when I enter face `1`.

Note that these _directions_ only make sense in the 2D representation.

I can build a map of all possible ways of leaving a face, with the corresponding entrance to a different face, like this:

```python
{ # each tuple is (face #, direction)
    (0, 3): (1, 1), # arrow a
    (0, 2): (2, 1), # arrow g
    (0, 0): (5, 2), # arrow b
    (1, 3): (0, 1), # arrow a
    (1, 2): (5, 3), # arrow d
    (1, 1): (4, 3), # arrow e
    (2, 3): (0, 0), # arrow g
    (2, 1): (4, 0), # arrow f
    (3, 0): (5, 1), # arrow c
    (4, 2): (2, 3), # arrow f
    (4, 1): (1, 3), # arrow e
    (5, 3): (3, 2), # arrow c
    (5, 0): (0, 2), # arrow b
    (5, 1): (1, 0)  # arrow d
}
```

So in the map above, we can see that `(0,3)` maps to `(1,1)`. What this means is: if you leave face `0` with direction `3` (i.e. _up_), then you'll enter face `1` with direction `1` (i.e. _down_).

To solve for Part 2, here's my strategy:

- First, externalise this cube's geometry into a separate input file. This is because the _real_ data uses a different cube geometry.  So I've got different files to represent my two cubes. The input file for the sample data cube looks like this:

```python
#   0
# 123
#   45
[
    [(2,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], # Faces 0-5
    { # each tuple is (face #, direction)
        (0, 3): (1, 1), # arrow a
        (0, 2): (2, 1), # arrow g
        (0, 0): (5, 2), # arrow b
        (1, 3): (0, 1), # arrow a
        (1, 2): (5, 3), # arrow d
        (1, 1): (4, 3), # arrow e
        (2, 3): (0, 0), # arrow g
        (2, 1): (4, 0), # arrow f
        (3, 0): (5, 1), # arrow c
        (4, 2): (2, 3), # arrow f
        (4, 1): (1, 3), # arrow e
        (5, 3): (3, 2), # arrow c
        (5, 0): (0, 2), # arrow b
        (5, 1): (1, 0)  # arrow d
    }
]
```

Note that I've represented the cube data in Python `list` format.  For this reason, I can read in the file as though it were a Python `list`, using [literal_eval()](/python/eval):

```python
    with open(INPUT_CUBE, mode="rt") as f:  # read in Cube input, in Python list format
        cube_data = literal_eval(f.read())
```

Thus, `cube_data` is now a `list`, where element `0` is the `list` of _faces_, and element `1` is the `dict` of _edge mappings_.

Then I create a new `CubeMap` class that extends `Map`, and which requires the `face_coords` and edge mapping data for our specific cube. 
- This class will determine the edge length of our faces.
- It overrides the `_next_posn()` method, so that when we reach an edge, instead of wrapping top-to-bottom or left-to-right, it:
  - Determines the face we will be entering, and the direction we will enter from, using the edge map.
  - Establishes the current relative `x, y` coordinate _within this face_.
  - Determines the new `x, y` coordinate we need when we enter the _next face_, in terms of a coordinate _within that face_.
  - Converts the target _face coordinate_ to a coordinate in the overall 2D grid.
  - Returns this new coordinate, along with the new direction.

Nothing else needs to change!!

The code for new class looks like this:

```python
class CubeMap(Map):
    """ Take a 2D grid that is made up of 6 regions, and convert to a cube.
    The face coordinates of the Cube must be supplied. """
    
    def __init__(self, grid: list[str], face_coords: list[tuple], face_edge_map: dict[tuple, tuple]) -> None:
        super().__init__(grid)
        
        self._face_coords = face_coords # the coordinates of the top-left vertices of this cube
        self._face_edge_map = face_edge_map

        self._h_faces_width = max(x for x,y in self._face_coords) + 1 # e.g. 4 faces wide
