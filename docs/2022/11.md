## Problem Intro

Naughty monkeys have stolen by stuff! They each have a number of my items. The `starting items` field of the input data gives tells us how worried I am about each item.  The input data looks something like this:

```text
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 1:
  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old + 6
  Test: divisible by 19
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 0
```

They are playing _Monkey in the Middle_. I'm the one in the midde. How it works:
- For each round of the game, Monkey 0 goes first, then Monkey 1, and so on.
  - The monkey inspects the first item it has. This causes my worry score to go up.
  - Then my worry score drops, according to the rule: divide by 3 and round down.
  - The monkey then throws this item to another monkey, based on the division test.
  - The monkey does this inspect-throw cycle, for every item it has, until there are no more items.

## Part 1

**What is the level of monkey business after 20 rounds of stuff-slinging simian shenanigans?**

We need to count how many times each monkey inspects my items. The value of `monkey business` is given by the product of this count from the two monkeys with the greatest count. 

Here's my approach:

- Create a `Monkey` class which:
  - Stores id, items (list), worry operation (str), test divisor, and inspection count.
  - Has an `inspect()` method which:
    - Increases this monkey's _inspect count_.
    - Retrieves the _worry score_ for the first item stored.
    - Performs the _worry operation_, which changes the worry score for this item.
    - Performs the _relief_ step, i.e. dividing by 3 and rounding down.
    - Performs the _division test_ by checking if the modulus of the divisor is 0, 
      and setting the target monkey accordingly.

```python
class Monkey:
    """ The monkey has a bunch of my things. 
    start_items = worry level for each item, in the order they will be inspectd
    worry_op = how worry level changes as the monkey inspects the item
    """
    def __init__(self, monkey_id: int, items: list, worry_op: str, div: int, throw_to: list) -> None:
        self.monkey_id = monkey_id # E.g. 0
        self.start_items = items # E.g. [79, 98]
        self._worry_op = worry_op  # E.g. old * 19
        self.divisor = div  # E.g. 13
        self._throw_to = throw_to # E.g. [2, 3]
        self.inspect_count = 0
    
    def add_item(self, item:int):
        self.start_items.append(item)
        
    def inspect(self) -> int:
        """ Inspects the next item in the list. 
        Inspecting causes our worry level to go up, as given by worry_op. 
        If relief enabled, we then reduce our worry level by //3.
        Then we work out who to throw to, by dividing by a divisor.
        
        In part 2:
          - relief is disabled and worry level can get VERY LARGE!!
          - We can significantly reduce this number by using LCM trick.
         """
        
        self.inspect_count += 1
        
        # turn "old * 19" into "79 * 19"
        worry_op = self._worry_op.replace("old", str(self.start_items[0]))
        
        first, the_op, second = re.findall(r"(\w+) (.) (\w+)", worry_op)[0]
        ops_dict = {
            "+": operator.add,
            "*": operator.mul
        }
        
        self.start_items[0] = ops_dict[the_op](int(first), int(second))
    
        # Relief. Rule = divide by three and round down
        self.start_items[0] //= 3
        
        return self._throw_to[0] if self.start_items[0] % self.divisor == 0 \
                                 else self._throw_to[1]
    
    def throw_to(self, other: Monkey):
        other.add_item(self.start_items.pop(0))
        
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Monkey:(id={self.monkey_id}, items={self.start_items}, " \
                + f"inspect_count={self.inspect_count})"
```

Next, read in the input data and create a list of Monkeys from this data.

```python
def parse_input(data: str) -> dict[int, Monkey]:
    blocks = data.split("\n\n")
    
    monkeys = {}
    for block in blocks:
        for line in block.splitlines():
            if line.startswith("Monkey"):
                monkey_id = int(re.findall(r"(\d+)", line)[0])
                
            if "items:" in line:
                items = list(map(int, re.findall(r"(\d+)", line)))

            if "Operation:" in line:
                worry_op = line.split("=")[-1].strip()
            
            if "Test:" in line:
                divisor = int(re.findall(r"\d+", line)[0])
            
            if "true:" in line:
                to_monkey_true = int(re.findall(r"\d+", line)[0])
            
            if "false:" in line:
                to_monkey_false = int(re.findall(r"\d+", line)[0])
                
        monkey = Monkey(monkey_id=monkey_id, items=items,
                        worry_op=worry_op, div=divisor, 
                        throw_to=[to_monkey_true, to_monkey_false])
        
        monkeys[monkey_id] = monkey
        
    return monkeys
```

Now we play 20 rounds of the game, as required:

```python
def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read()
        
    monkeys = parse_input(data)
    print("\n".join(str(monkey) for id, monkey in monkeys.items()))

    # Part 1
    monkey_business = play(copy.deepcopy(monkeys), 20)
    print(f"Part 1: monkey business={monkey_business}")

def play(monkeys: dict[int, Monkey], rounds_to_play: int) -> int:
    """ Play required number of rounds.
    Returns 'Monkey Business' = product of the top two inspection counts """
    for _ in range(1, rounds_to_play+1):
        for monkey in monkeys.values(): # Iterator through monkeys in order
            while monkey.start_items: # Monkey inspects and throws until it has no more items
                to_monkey = monkeys[monkey.inspect()]
                monkey.throw_to(to_monkey)
    
    # Get the two monkeys that have inspected the most
    monkey_inspect = Counter({monkey.monkey_id: monkey.inspect_count for monkey in monkeys.values()})
    two_most_common = monkey_inspect.most_common(2)
    return two_most_common[0][1] * two_most_common[1][1]
```

That wasn't too bad!

## Part 2

Urgh, I spoke too soon.

We're told that the worry _relief_ step no longer happens.

**What is the level of monkey business after 10000 rounds?**

The problem here is that the worry score gets very large, very quickly!!  In the output below, I'm printing the worry score of just the first item held by monkey 5, for each round of the game.  Look how fast it grows!!

```text
Round 1, monkey 5, first item: 60
Round 2, monkey 5, first item: 65
Round 3, monkey 5, first item: 4357
Round 4, monkey 5, first item: 302501
Round 5, monkey 5, first item: 574565
Round 6, monkey 5, first item: 1132995601
Round 7, monkey 5, first item: 112973965457
Round 8, monkey 5, first item: 66345395777
Round 9, monkey 5, first item: 145983598085
Round 10, monkey 5, first item: 869291291519169243077
Round 11, monkey 5, first item: 194394222161788859717
Round 13, monkey 5, first item: 3707953477216897791636998597
Round 14, monkey 5, first item: 91435749290838899413486607953237309215210917
Round 15, monkey 5, first item: 91435749290838899413486607953237309215210917
Round 16, monkey 5, first item: 475305472147531532905077008835042795254612334925925
Round 17, monkey 5, first item: 10978531075057958773242647614034395559845342277
Round 18, monkey 5, first item: 3327138305032720730335539061845299566782286344481543
Round 19, monkey 5, first item: 3994349693662791921638935654895733812151353491072884187125317
Round 20, monkey 5, first item: 2428899730574776919351574517249403431446194393675444403748819090519729633297989697799769895877
```

Yeah... So this isn't going to get anywhere near 10000 rounds!!

The important thing to realise is that we only care about the remainder of the division operation with our worry score.  And furthermore, according to _modulo arithmetic_, there are some rules that are really useful to us:

`If a≡b(mod M) and b=d(mod m) then a≡d(mod m)`

Here `≡` means "is congruent to".  So `a` is congruent to `b (mod M)`.

Using Mod 5 as an example:

`If 11≡1(mod 5) and 1=26(mod 5) then 11≡26(mod 5)`

This means that `11` is congruent to `1 (mod 5)`. Of course, `1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26...` are all congruent
to `1 (mod 5)`, since they all result in a remainder of `1`. They are all in the same _remainder group_.

And:

`If a≡b(mod m), then a+c≡b+c(mod m)` \
`If a≡b(mod m), then ax≡bx(mod mx)`

I.e. if a and b are in the same bucket, then the remainder of division is preserved if we add a constant to either. E.g.

`If 11≡26(mod 5), then 11+1≡(26+1)(mod 5)`

This is obviously true, since `12(mod 5) = 2` and `27(mod 5) = 2`.

`If 11≡26(mod 5), then (11*9)≡(26*9)(mod 5*9)`.

We can show that `99≡234(mod 45)`, because `99(mod 5) = 9` and `234(mod 45) = 9`.

In Part 2, we don't have to divide the worry score any more.  And our `worry operation` only ever multiplies or adds to the worry score. This is crucial: **modulo congruence is preserved for any multiplication or addition operations**.

So that means that even after we apply our _worry operation_, the remainder of our modulo operation will be unchanged. So, because we only need to maintain a worry value that returns the same remainder, we have an option to store `w (mod n)` rather than `w`, for any worry value, `w`. This will be a much smaller number than `w` and will never grow beyond the size of `n`.  But what value of `n` can we use?

It needs to be a multiple of our modulo divisors. In general, we should use the _lowest column multiple_ of all our divisors, since the LCM will work for every divisor we need to test with. But in the case of this particular problem, all our divisors are prime numbers. And for that reason, the LCM is actually just the product of all our divisors.  But, we more generally, we can always just use the `math.lcm()` function. 

Putting this all together...

First, we need to change our `inspect()` method:

```python
    def inspect(self, relief=True, lcm=None) -> int:
        """ Inspects the next item in the list. 
        Inspecting causes our worry level to go up, as given by worry_op. 
        If relief enabled, we then reduce our worry level by //3.
        Then we work out who to throw to, by dividing by a divisor.
        
        In part 2:
          - relief is disabled and worry level can get VERY LARGE!!
          - We can significantly reduce this number by using LCM trick.
         """
        
        self.inspect_count += 1
        
        # turn "old * 19" into "79 * 19"
        worry_op = self._worry_op.replace("old", str(self.start_items[0]))
        
        first, the_op, second = re.findall(r"(\w+) (.) (\w+)", worry_op)[0]
        ops_dict = {
            "+": operator.add,
            "*": operator.mul
        }
        
        self.start_items[0] = ops_dict[the_op](int(first), int(second))
    
        # Relief. Rule = divide by three and round down
        if relief:
            self.start_items[0] //= 3
        
        if lcm:
            self.start_items[0] %= lcm
        
        return self._throw_to[0] if self.start_items[0] % self.divisor == 0 \
                                 else self._throw_to[1]
```

Note that I've changed the method signature, so that we can perform both Part 1 and Part 2.  But what can't we use the same approach for both parts?  The answer: because **division does not preserve modulo congruence**.  And since Part 1 requires us to divide by three, we can't use the _LCM_ approach for Part 1.

Blimey. That was hard!
