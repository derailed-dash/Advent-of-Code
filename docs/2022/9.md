## Problem Intro

This one was fun.  Solving the problem took me an hour or so.  But then I spent far too long creating a visualisation!

The goal is model the behaviour of a strange rope.  The rope has a knot at each end: the _head_ and the _tail_. At the beginning, both the head and tail occupy the same space. 

The head of the rope is moved according to a set of instructions that look like this:

```text
R 5
U 8
L 8
D 3
R 17
D 10
L 25
U 20
```

We're told that whenever we move the head, the tail must move in order to remain adjacent to the head.

## Part 1

**How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?**

My strategy:
- Create a `Point` dataclass to store locations.
  - It should know how to add and subtract other Points, in order to get the vector between points.
  - It should know how to generate a list of locations that are adjacent to it, and include it. We'll use this to determine if the tail is adjacent to the head.
- Create points for the _head_ and _tail_, and arbitrarily set them to `Point (0,0)`.
- Store each tail position in a `set`.  This is how we record locations that have been visited at least once.- Then process each movement instruction:
  - For each step in the instruction (since an instruction has a direction and a magnitude):
    - Add the movement vector to _head_, to create new _head_ location.
    - Get the vector between the new _head_ and _tail_.
    - If the tail needs to move to catch up, determine the movement required.
    - Add the movement to the tail to create the new tail location, and store this in our _visisted_ set.
  - Return the size of the _visisted_ set.

First, the `Point` [dataclass](/python/classes#dataclass):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point:
    """ Class for storing a point x,y coordinate """
    x: int
    y: int
    
    # create a list of (x,y) vectors that surround and include this point
    WITHIN_ONE = [(dx,dy) for dx in range(-1, 2) for dy in range(-1, 2)]
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
```

Notes on this class:
- We have overidden the `__add__()` and `__sub__()` methods, thus allowing points to be added or subtracted using standard operators, i.e. using `+` and `-`, respectively.
- We have used [list comprehension](/python/comprehenions) to generate a list of all relative vectors that would be valid positions for the _tail_, compared to the _head_, i.e. \
`[(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]`

Then we've created `VECTOR dict`, to convert our input instructions to points/vectors:

```python
VECTORS = {
    'U': Point(0, 1),
    'R': Point(1, 0),
    'D': Point(0, -1),
    'L': Point(-1, 0)
}
```

Finally, I create a `RopeSim class`:

```python
class RopeSim():
    """ Simulates a rope with a number of knots. We move the head according to a set of instructions. 
    Here we model the movement of the knots behind the head, according to the rules specified. """
    
    def __init__(self, motions: list[tuple[str, int]], num_knots: int) -> None:
        """ Expects a list of instructions in the format:
        [['R', 5], ['U', 8], ...]
        
        Models rope with num_knots. The first is the head, and the last is the tail. """
        self._instructions = motions
        self._num_knots = num_knots
        self._knots = [Point(0,0) for _ in range(self._num_knots)] 
    
    @staticmethod
    def _get_next_move(vector: Point) -> Point:
        x_move = y_move = 0
        move_x = move_y = False
        
        if vector.y == 0:   # we only need to move left or right
            move_x = True
        elif vector.x == 0: # we only need to move up or down
            move_y = True
        else: # we need to move diagonally
            assert vector.x != 0 and vector.y != 0, "We must move diagonally"
            move_x = move_y = True
        
        if move_x:
            x_move = 1 if vector.x > 0 else -1
        
        if move_y:
            y_move = 1 if vector.y > 0 else -1

        return Point(x_move, y_move)
    
    def pull_rope(self) -> set[Point]:
        """ Simulate the rope knot movemens, according to the rules given. """
        
        visited_locations: set[Point] = set()
        visited_locations.add(self._knots[-1]) # track the tail
        
        for direction, mag in self._instructions: # read char by char
            for _ in range(mag): # move one step at a time
                # print(f"Tail: {knots[-1]}; unique positions: {len(visited_locations)}")
                self._knots[0] += VECTORS[direction] # move the head
                
                for i in range(1, len(self._knots)): # move the tail
                    vector = self._knots[i-1] - self._knots[i]
                    
                    if vector in [Point(x,y) for (x,y) in Point.WITHIN_ONE]:
                        continue # don't need to move
                    else:
                        self._knots[i] = self._knots[i] + RopeSim._get_next_move(vector)
                        visited_locations.add(self._knots[-1])
    
        return visited_locations
```

I didn't really need to use a class for this.  But later, I wanted to add a visualisation, and doing this with a class just made life easier.

- Notes on the `__init__()` method:
  - For Part 1, we instantiate our class with `2` knots: the _head_ and _tail_.
  - We then use _list comprehension_ to set both knots to a `Point` of `0,0`.

- Notes on the `_get_next_move(vector: Point)` method:
  - This method expects the vector between the _head_ and the _tail_.
  - If the _tail_ is in the same row or column as the _head_, then we only need to move one unit towards the _head_ in that axis.
  - Otherwise, we know the _tail_ needs to move diagonally towards the _head_.
  - Note that the `x` and `y` components of the vector will never exceed 1.

- Notes on the `pull_rope()` method:
  - This is where we execute the movement instructions.
  - Create a `visited set` to store every location that _tail_ has been.
  - Get the next movement instruction:
    - For each _step_ in the instruction:
      - Move the _head_ by adding the appropriate direction vector.
      - For each successive remaining knot, of which there is only one:
        - Determine the vector between this knot and the head.
        - Check whether this vector is in our `WITHIN_ONE` list. If it is, then the _tail_ is already adjacent to (or in the same spot as) the _head_.
        - If it isn't, call our `_get_next_move()` method to determine the movement required for the _tail_.
        - Add this move, and store the new location of the _tail_.

Now all we need to do is read our data, pass it to our `RopeSim`, and execute the `pull_rope()` method:

```python
def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        # convert to list of (direction, magnitude)
        data = [(d, int(v)) for d, v in [instruction.split() for instruction in f.read().splitlines()]]
        
    rope_sim = RopeSim(data, 2)
    visited_locations = rope_sim.pull_rope()
    print(len(visited_locations))
```

## Part 2

Now we're told the rope has mulitple knots. Each knot behaves like the tail to the knot in front of it.

**Simulate your complete series of motions on a larger rope with ten knots. How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?**

Marvellous!!  I don't need to change anything!  I just need to pass in `10` knots, instead of `2`.

```python
    rope_sim = RopeSim(data, 10)
    visited_locations = rope_sim.pull_rope()
    print(len(visited_locations))
```

## Results

    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    main()
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    print(f"Execution time: {t2 - t1:0.4f} seconds")
```

The output looks like this:

```text

2607
Execution time: 0.4464 seconds
```

## Visualisation

This problem seems like a prime candidate for a cool visualisation.  So I've had a go at creating an animation.

First, we need some extra imports:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from pathlib import Path
import time
import imageio as iio
from tqdm import tqdm
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.markers import MarkerStyle
from matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator
```

Then I create an `Animator` class, which just happens to be _Context Manager_. I'll talk about that another time!

```python
class Animator():
    """ Creates an animation file of specified target size. 
    Designed to be used as Context Manager. E.g. 
    with Animator(file=Path("path/to/file""), fps=num) as animator:
        # code
    """
   
    def __enter__(self):
        """ Required for ContextManager implementation. """
        if self._enabled:
            self._create_path()
        
        return self # so the as <name> returns an object
            
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        """ Required for ContextManager implementation. """
        if self._enabled:
            self._save_anim()
        
    def __init__(self, file: Path, fps: int, loop=1, enabled=True) -> None:
        """ Create an Animator. Suggest the file should be a .gif.
        Set frames per second (fps). 
        Set loop to 0, to loop indefinitely. Default is 1. """
        self._enabled = enabled
        self._outputfile = file
        self._frames = []  # can be in-memory BytesIO objects, or files
        self._fps = fps
        self._loop = loop
        
    @property
    def enabled(self):
        return self._enabled
    
    @enabled.setter
    def enabled(self, value: bool):
        self._enabled = value
    
    def _create_path(self):
        if self._enabled:
            dir_path = Path(self._outputfile).parent
            if not Path.exists(dir_path):
                Path.mkdir(dir_path)
    
    def _save_anim(self):
        """ Takes animation frames, and converts to a single animated file. """
        with iio.get_writer(self._outputfile, mode='I', fps=self._fps, loop=self._loop) as writer:
            for frame in tqdm(self._frames):
                image = iio.imread(frame)
                writer.append_data(image)
                
        print(f"Animation saved to {self._outputfile}")
    
    def add_frame(self, frame):
        """ Add a frame to the animation.
        The frame can be in the form of a BytesIO object, or a file Path
        """
        self._frames.append(frame)
```

I won't go into this class in detail. But a few notes...

- The `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods allow me to use this class as a _Context Manager_, i.e. so that I can say `with Animator...`, much like we do when we say `with open(...)`.
- The `__init__()` method accepts a parameter that can be used to DISABLE this animator. This is handy, since rendering animations is time consuming.
- The `add_frame()` method is intended to be called by our application code, whenever we have a frame - such as Maplotlib plot - that we're ready to add to our animation.
- The `_save_anim()` writes our frames to a file on the disk. This method gets called automatically at the end of our `with` context block, assuming the `Animator` has not been disabled. We also use `tqdm` to show a progress bar on the screen as we build the animation.

Now we need to actually generate our visual frames.  To do that, we add the following two methods to our `RopeSim` class:

```python
    def _init_plt(self):
        """ Generate a Figure and Axes objects which are reused. """
        my_dpi = 120
        figure, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(1024/my_dpi, 768/my_dpi), dpi=my_dpi, facecolor="white") # set size in pixels
        axes.set_aspect('equal') # set x and y to equal aspect
        axes.set_facecolor('xkcd:black')
        
        return figure, axes
    
    def _render_frame(self, visited: set[Point], iteration: int=0):
        """ Only renders an animation frame if we've attached an enabled Animator """
        
        fig, axes = self._plt_info
        axes.clear()
        
        # The grid will grow as the rope heads moves around
        max_x = max(self._all_head_locations, key=lambda point: point.x).x
        min_x = min(self._all_head_locations, key=lambda point: point.x).x
        max_y = max(self._all_head_locations, key=lambda point: point.y).y
        min_y = min(self._all_head_locations, key=lambda point: point.y).y
        axes.set_xlim(min_x - 2, max_x + 2)
        axes.set_ylim(min_y - 2, max_y + 2)

        # dynamically compute the marker size
        fig.canvas.draw()
        factor = 40  # Smaller factor means smaller markers
        mkr_size = int((axes.get_window_extent().width / (max_x-min_x+1) * (factor/fig.dpi)) ** 2)

        # make sure the ticks have integer values
        axes.xaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(integer=True))
        
        head = self._knots[0]
        tail = self._knots[-1]
        others_knots = self._knots[1:-1]
        
        visited_x = [point.x for point in visited if point != tail]
        visited_y = [point.y for point in visited if point != tail]

        for knot in others_knots:
            axes.scatter(knot.x, knot.y, marker=MarkerStyle("."), s=mkr_size/2, color="white")
            
        axes.scatter(head.x, head.y, marker=MarkerStyle("."), s=mkr_size, color="red")
        axes.scatter(visited_x, visited_y, marker=MarkerStyle("x"), s=mkr_size/3, color="grey")
        axes.scatter(tail.x, tail.y, marker=MarkerStyle("*"), s=mkr_size/2, color="yellow")
                
        axes.set_title(f"Iteration: {iteration}; tail has visited {len(visited)} locations")
        
        # save the plot as a frame; store the frame in-memory, using a BytesIO buffer
        frame = BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(frame, format='png') # save to memory, rather than file
        self._animator.add_frame(frame)
```

The `_render_frame()` method uses _Matplotlib_ to render a scatter plot, using different colours for the head, the tail, the knots in between, and the _visited_ set. At the end of the method, we save the current plot to a `BytesIO` object in memory, and then call our _Animator_ `add_frame()` method to add it to the list of frames that will ultimately be converted to a file-based animation.

We also need to set the _animator_ and initialise our Matplotlib plot, in our `RopeSim __init__()` method:

```python
        self._animator: Animator = animator
        self._plt_info = self._init_plt()  # contains (figure, axes)
```

Finally, we need to call `_render_frame()` whenever we move a knot. So our `pull_rope()` method now looks like this:

```python
    def pull_rope(self) -> set[Point]:
        """ Simulate the rope knot movemens, according to the rules given. """
        
        visited_locations: set[Point] = set()
        visited_locations.add(self._knots[-1]) # track the tail
        
        step = 0
        for direction, mag in self._instructions: # read char by char
            for _ in range(mag): # move one step at a time
                # print(f"Tail: {knots[-1]}; unique positions: {len(visited_locations)}")
                self._knots[0] += VECTORS[direction] # move the head
                self._all_head_locations.add(self._knots[0])
                
                for i in range(1, len(self._knots)): # move the tail
                    step += 1
