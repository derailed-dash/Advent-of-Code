## Problem Intro

This was the first challenge this year that I found a little bit tricky. It took me longer than it should have... Probably 90 minutes in total. I made a couple of errors along the way that I needed to debug.  And I possibly overengineered it!

But oh well... You get bad days!

Today's challenge is basically about writing a program that can create and navigate a file system directory tree.

The input data looks something like this:

```text
$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
14848514 b.txt
8504156 c.dat
dir d
$ cd a
$ ls
dir e
29116 f
2557 g
62596 h.lst
```

We're told:

- Lines starting with `$` are commands.  These are the only commands we need to deal with:
  - `$ cd <some_dir>` - change to the specified directory
  - `$ cd ..` - move up one directory
  - `$ ls` - list the current directory

- If a line doesn't start with `$`, then we must be listing a directory's contents. I.e. the previous command was `ls`. Directory listings only contain two different types of information:
  - `dir <some_dir>` - A subdirectory, within this directory
  - `<size> <some_file>` - A file, and its size.

## Part 1

**Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?**

Okay, here's my solution...

First, I create a [dataclass](/python/classes#dataclass) to represent a `File` object:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class File:
    "Has name and size"
    name: str
    size: int
```

Nothing new there!

Then I create a class to represent a `Directory`:

```python
class Directory:
    """ Represents a file system directory object. Has parent dir (if not root), subdirs, and files.
    Knows how to return ALL directories and subdirectories.
    Knows how to return total size occupied by this directory and all subdirectories. """
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self._name = name
        self._files: list[File] = []     # files in this dir
        self._dirs: list[Directory] = [] # directories in this dir
    
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    def add_file(self, a_file: File):
        """ Add a File to this directory """
        self._files.append(a_file)
        
    def add_directory(self, a_dir: Directory):
        """ Add a Directory to this directory. Set THIS directory to be its parent dir. """
        self._dirs.append(a_dir)
        a_dir.parent_dir = self    
    
    @property
    def parent_dir(self):
        """ Get the parent directory of this dir. """
        return self._parent_dir
    
    @parent_dir.setter
    def parent_dir(self, a_dir: Directory):
        self._parent_dir = a_dir
    
    @property 
    def directories(self):
        """ Return directories at THIS level. """
        return self._dirs
    
    def get_directory(self, name: str) -> Directory:
        """ Return a directoy by name, at THIS level. """
        return next(dir for dir in self.directories if dir.name == name)
    
    def get_all_dirs(self) -> list[Directory]:
        """ Get ALL directories at this level and below. """
        all_dirs = []
        for a_dir in self.directories:
            all_dirs.extend(a_dir.get_all_dirs())
        
        all_dirs.extend(self.directories)
        
        return all_dirs
    
    @property
    def size(self):
        """ The sum of the files in this dir, as well as the sum of all subdirs. """
        return sum(file.size for file in self._files) + sum(dir.size for dir in self._dirs)
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(name={self.name}, size={self.size}, dirs={len(self.directories)})"
```

There's quite a lot going on here!

- The `__init__()` method sets the name of this directory, and creates empty lists to store any _files_ and any _subdirectores_.
- I defined a few _properties_, e.g. the `name` property.
- I provide a method to add a `File` to this `Directory`. It simply adds the file to the `self._files list`.
- I provide a method that allows us to set the _parent directory_ of this `Directory`. Whenever we create a new `Directory` object, we'll set the parent directory to the be the `Directory` we're currently in.
- I provide a method to add a `Directory` to this `Directory`.
  - It adds the `Directory` to the `self._dirs list`.
  - It also sets the _parent directory_ of the newly added `Directory`, and sets it to be `self`.
- I provide a method that returns a `Directory` object given a name. We'll use this when we `cd` from a directory to one of its subdirectories. This is actually done using a _generator_. A _generator_ looks a lot like a _list comprehension_, except that we use `()` rather than `[]`. A _generator_ behaves a lot like an _iterator_, except it returns one-item-at-a-time, on demand. Here, I'm using it, in conjunction with the `next` keyword, to return just the first item of a _generator_. This is how I return a single `Directory` from `list`, having supplied a name.
- I provide a method that returns ALL the directories in _this_ `Directory`. I.e. all `Directory` objects in the current directory, but also all `Directory` objects in any subdirectories, and so on.  Thus, this method is [recursive](/python/recursion).
- I provide a `size` _property_. It works by adding up the size of all the `File` objects in this `Directory`, but then recurses into each subdirectory and adds up the files there too. Yes, more recursion.
- Finally, a provide a `__repr__()` method that we can use to print the value of a given `Directory`. This is really useful for debugging!

Oh, one last thing.  Because the `Directory` class refers to the `Directory` class in its own code (in various methods), we need to add this line to prevent the linter from moaning that `Directory` has not yet been defined:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
```

Next, we need to parse our list of command line instructions!

Here's my code to do that:

```python
def fs_parse(instructions: list[str]) -> Directory:
    """ Processes instructions, builds directory tree, and returns the root directory.
    
    Lines starting with $ are commands
      $ cd ..
      $ cd some_dir
      $ ls 
    
    Else, lines are listings, which show either:
      sz some_file
      dir some_dir
    """
    root_dir = Directory("/")
    current_dir = root_dir
    
    for line in instructions:
        if line.startswith("$"): # this line is a command
            cmd_line = line.split()
            cmd = cmd_line[1]
            if cmd == "ls":
                continue # we're now in directory list mode, so skip to next line
            if cmd == "cd": # Changing directory
                arg = cmd_line[2]
                if arg == "..": # Going back up a level
                    assert current_dir.parent_dir, "We're not at root"
                    current_dir = current_dir.parent_dir
                else: # Change to named directory
                    if arg != '/': # Changing to named dir. We need find the directory in our list.
                        # It is possible to have multiple directories with the same name.
                        # But directory names are unique within the current directory.
                        current_dir = current_dir.get_directory(arg)
                    else: # Change to root. Only happens once at the top of the instructions.
                        current_dir = root_dir 
            else:
                assert False, "There is no other valid command!"
        else: # we must be dir listing
            ls_line = line.split()
            if ls_line[0] == "dir": # add a new directory
                new_dir = Directory(ls_line[1])
                current_dir.add_directory(new_dir) # add as subdirectory to current dir
            else: # must be a file
                file = File(ls_line[1], size=int(ls_line[0]))
                current_dir.add_file(file)
    
    return root_dir
```

The code is pretty well documented, so you should be able to follow it without much trouble.  A couple of notes...

- We start by creating a `Directory` for the `root`. All directories and files that we find will be - either directly or indirectly - under the `root`. At the end of the function, we return just this `root Directory` object.
- The code is either processing commands - i.e. for a line starting with `$`, or it is processing `ls` output.
- Note how the code allows us to set the current `Directory` to be named `Directory` under _current_, or to be the _parent_ of _current_. In either case, the _current_ `Directory` always holds a reference to the appropriate object.
- I'm using [assert](/python/assertion) to check for conditions that I know should never happen. If I had any bad logic in my code, this _assertion_ would help me find it.
- Note that when I'm adding new `Directory` objects to an existing `Directory`, I don't have to do anything to set the new directory's parent.  That's because this is taken care of in the `Directory` class itself. As it should be!

Okay, believe it or not, we've done all the hard work now!  Solving the problem is now, finally, quite trivial!

```python
    # Part 1
    all_dirs = root_dir.get_all_dirs()
    print(f"All dirs count={len(all_dirs)}.")
    
    # Find all the directories smaller than the target size, and add up their sizes
    small_dirs = [a_dir for a_dir in all_dirs if a_dir.size <= MAX_SZ]
    print(f"\nPart 1: Small dirs total = {sum(dir.size for dir in small_dirs)}")
```

How does this work?

- We get all the directories under the root.
- We then use _list comprehension_ to return a subset of those directories; namely, the ones that are smaller or equal to our size threshold.
- Finally, we use the `sum()` function to add up the sizes of all these _small_ directories.

Phew!!

## Part 2

- We're told that the file system stores 70000000 bytes.
- We're told that we need a minimum of 30000000 bytes free.
- We're told that the current number of bytes free is given by the total file system size, minus the size that our `root` directory reports back.

**Find the smallest directory that, if deleted, would free up enough space on the filesystem to run the update. What is the total size of that directory?**

Fortunately, because of the hard work we've already done, this is really easy to do:

```python
    # Part 2
    unused_space = FS_SZ - root_dir.size # Total FS size, minus current used
    extra_free_req = FREE_REQ - unused_space
    print(f"\nCurrent nused space={unused_space}; extra space required={extra_free_req}")
    
    # Find all directories that would liberate enough space
    # Then we want the smallest that would be big enough.
    dirs_big_enough = [a_dir for a_dir in all_dirs if a_dir.size >= extra_free_req]
    smallest_big_dir = min(dirs_big_enough, key=lambda x: x.size)
    print(f"Part 2: Smallest directory we can delete={smallest_big_dir.name}: {smallest_big_dir.size}")
```

- First, we work out how much extra space needs to be freed up.
- Then, we work out which directories are at least as big as this number.  It's basically the same as Part 1, except we're looking for directories greater-than-or-equal-to a threshold, rather than less-than-or-equal-to.
- Once we have our new list of _directories that are big enough_, we just need to find the smallest one. I'm doing this using the `min()` function, and setting the _key_ of the `min()` function to be `size` property of our `Directory` object. I do this with a [lambda function](/python/functions#lambda-functions).

## Results

Here's the final code:

```python

SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
# INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/sample_input.txt")

FREE_REQ = 30000000

I'm glad that's over!!
