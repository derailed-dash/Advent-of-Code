## Problem Intro

About this time every year, we find AoC starts to itensify. And sometimes you get a problem where you either:

- _just know_ how to do it, and it's easy.
- _have no idea_, and it's a nightmare.

For me, yesterday was a bit of a nightmare.  But today was a relief because I do like a BFS problem!!  A couple of years ago, I didn't know my way around path-solving algorithms, and a problem like this one would have taken me forever. So it's quite satisfying to be able to deploy knowledge acquired as a result of previous time and effort.

If you don't know anything about algorithms like BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, and A*, then YOU NEED TO [LOOK AT MY GUIDE](/python/shortest_paths).  Honestly, it will totally change AoC experience!

Okay, so today's problem...

Our input is a grid of elevation data. Elevation is represented by `a-z`, 
where `a` is the lowest possible elevation, and `z` is the higest possible elevation.

The input data looks like this:

```text
Sabqponm
abcryxxl
accszExk
acctuvwj
abdefghi
```

`S` is our _start_ position and `E` is our goal. 

From `S`, we can move to any adjacent position by moving left, right, up, or down; but only if the adjacent position's elevation is less than or equal to: our current elevation, plus 1.

## Part 1

**What is the fewest steps required to move from your current position to the location that should get the best signal?**

This is a pretty simple BFS!!  Check my guide for how BFS works.

First, a bit of importing, and a `Point` class:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path
import time

SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
# INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/sample_input.txt")
INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/input.txt")

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    """ Point class, which knows how to return a list of all adjacent coordinates """    
    x: int
    y: int
    
    def neighbours(self) -> list[Point]:
        """ Return all adjacent orthogonal (not diagonal) Points """
        return [Point(self.x+dx, self.y+dy) for dx in range(-1, 2)
                                            for dy in range(-1, 2)
                                            if abs(dy) != abs(dx)]
```

Note that this `Point` class is able to return a list of all its neighbours.  It does this with a _list comprehension_.

Next, our `Grid` class:

```python
class Grid():
    """ 2D grid of point values. """
       
    def __init__(self, grid_array: list[str]) -> None:
        """ Generate Grid instance from 2D array. 
        This works on a deep copy of the input data, so as not to mutate the input. """                                         
        self.array = deepcopy(grid_array)  # Store a deep copy of input data
        self.x_size = len(self.array[0])
        self.y_size = len(self.array)
        self.start = self._get_point_for_elevation("S")
        self.goal = self._get_point_for_elevation("E")
        
    def _all_points(self) -> list[Point]:
        points = [Point(x, y) for x in range(self.x_size) for y in range(self.y_size)]
        return points
    
    def _get_point_for_elevation(self, x: str) -> Point:
        """ Use this to find the point where "S" or "E" are located. """
        assert x in ("S", "E"), "Specified point must be Start or End!"
        for row_num, row in enumerate(self.array):
            if x in row:
                return Point(row.index(x), row_num)
    
    def elevation_at_point(self, point: Point) -> int:
        """ Elevation value at this point """
        if point not in (self.start, self.goal):
            return ord(self.array[point.y][point.x])
        
        if point == self.start:
            return ord("a") # we're told start location is elevation a

        if point == self.goal:
            return ord("z") # we're told start location is elevation z
    
    def _point_in_grid(self, point: Point) -> bool:
        """ Check if a location is within the grid """
        if (0 <= point.x < self.x_size and 0 <= point.y < self.y_size):
            return True
        
        return False
    
    def _valid_neighbours(self, location:Point):
        """ Yield adjacent neighbour points.
        We can move L, R, U, D by one unit. But we can only move to locations that
        are no more than one higher than current elevation. """
        current_elevation = self.elevation_at_point(location)
        
        for neighbour in location.neighbours():
            if self._point_in_grid(neighbour):
                if self.elevation_at_point(neighbour) <= current_elevation + 1:
                    yield neighbour

    def get_path(self, start: Point):
        """ Given a start point, determine best path to reach the goal specified by 'E'. 
        Returns: list of points that make up the path
             or: None, if no valid path from this start point. 
        """
        points_to_assess: deque[Point] = deque()  # Points we want to get value of, and get neighbours for
        points_to_assess.append(start)   # where we start

        came_from = {}
        came_from[start] = None
        
        while points_to_assess:     # They should only ever be valid points
            current = points_to_assess.popleft()
            
            if current == self.goal:  # We've reached the end
                break
            
            for neighbour in self._valid_neighbours(current):
                if neighbour not in came_from:   # We will need to assess this point
                    points_to_assess.append(neighbour)
                    came_from[neighbour] = current
                    
        # build the breadcrumb path
        current = self.goal
        path = []
        while current != start: 
            path.append(current)
            current = came_from[current]
        
        return path

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "\n".join("".join(map(str, row)) for row in self.array)     
```

A few points about the above code:

- `_point_in_grid()` is used to check if a point is within the grid.
- `_valid_neighbours()` iterates through the _neighbours_ of our point, 
  and checks whether this neighbour is _valid_, given the rules about elevation.
- `get_path()` works by:
  - Performing a BFS from `S` to `E`.
  - Uses a `dictionary` to explore the explored points, and to build the breadcrumb trail.

Now we solve as follows:

```python
def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read().splitlines()
        
    grid = Grid(data)
    
    # Part 1
    path = grid.get_path(grid.start)
    p1_length = len(path)
    print(f"Part 1: {p1_length}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    main()
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    print(f"Execution time: {t2 - t1:0.4f} seconds")
```

Easy when you know how!

## Part 2

**What is the fewest steps required to move starting from any square with elevation a to the location that should get the best signal?**

_"Oh awesome!"_, I thought to myself. All I need to do is:

- Get a list of all the points with elevation `a`.
- Perform exactly the same BFS, but using each new start location, rather than `S`.

So, that's what I did.  It worked straight away with the sample code.  And then throw an exception with the real data.  Doh!!

It turns out there's a small gotcha, which took me quite a few minutes to debug.  It turns out that many of the `a` start locations in the real data _DO NOT HAVE SOLUTIONS_. So we need to handle that situation.

Here are my changes to solve this part...

First, we add this method to our `Grid` class:

```python
    def all_lowest_elevation_points(self) -> set[Point]:
        low_points = {point for point in self._all_points() 
                        if self.array[point.y][point.x] == "a"
                        or self.array[point.y][point.x] == "S"}
        return low_points
```

Then we need to handle the "no solution" scenario. We just add this code in the `get_path()` method, 
before building our breadcrumbs.

```python
        if current != self.goal:
            return None # No valid path from this point
```

Then we just add this to our `main()` method:

```python
    # Part 2
    start_points = grid.all_lowest_elevation_points()
    p2_length = p1_length
    for start in start_points:
        path = grid.get_path(start)
        if path:
            p2_length = min(p2_length, len(path))

    print(f"Part 2: {p2_length}")
```

## Results

```python
