## Problem Intro

We would like to collect geodes.  In order to do so, we need:

- Geode-cracking robots, to release the geodes
- Obsidian-collecting robots
- Clay-collecting robots
- Ore-collecting robots; we start with one of these.

Timings:
- Each robot can collect one of its corresponding resource per minute.
- Our robot factory can assemble any robot from its requisite ingrediens in one minute.
  The resources are consumed at the beginning of any fabrication minute.

The input data looks like this:

```text
Blueprint 1: Each ore robot costs 4 ore. Each clay robot costs 2 ore. Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay. Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.
Blueprint 2: Each ore robot costs 2 ore. Each clay robot costs 3 ore. Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay. Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.
```
