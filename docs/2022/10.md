## Problem Intro

Not too bad, this one.  But it still took me a couple of hours. I think my brain wasn't working properly this morning.

We're told we have a We have a CRT CPU that processes instructions. It has a single register, `x`. There is only one instruction that modifies `x`, called `addx`. The other instruction, `noop`, does nothing.

The input is our instructions, and it looks something like this:

```text
addx 15
addx -11
addx 6
addx -3
addx 5
addx -1
addx -8
addx 13
addx 4
noop
addx -1
```

Instructions start on a given clock _cycle_, aka _tick_. The `addx` instruction requires 2 ticks; noop takes only 1. We're also told that signal strength is given by the product of the current cycle, and the current value in register `x`.

## Part 1

**Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles. What is the sum of these six signal strengths?**

Here's my strategy:

- Create a `CrtComputer` class that takes instructions as a parameter.
  - Track the current instruction in an _instruction pointer_.
  - Track which instruction was last started, by storing it to a `self._doing` property. 
    - This property contains both the instruction itself (command and value), and the number of cycles required to complete it.
    - We will decrement this _cycles required_ count with each tick.
    - When the value reaches 0, we can complete the task the instruction was meant to do.
  - Externalise a tick method. This:
    - Increments the cycle.
    - If an instruction is ready to complete, it executes the completion by retrieving the instruction from `self._doing`. It then starts the next instructions.
  - Provide a method to calculate and return the signal strength at any time.
  - Externalise a property to inform the caller when the program is finished.
- From the calling application, _tick_ the computer for as long as the program hasn't completed. 
  - With each tick, check if we're on one of our required cycles.  If so, retrieve the signal strength and store it.
  - Finally, add up our signal strengths.

The code looks like this:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import time

SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
# INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/sample_input.txt")
INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/input.txt")

```

## Part 2

We're told that we have a 40x6 display. With each tick, the current pixel is incremented by 1. The movement is across, then down... Like a typewriter.

We're told that the `x` register stores the middle x (row) position of a sprite, which is itself three pixels wide. We're told that if the current display pixel coincides with any of the three horizontal pixels that make up the sprite, then this pixel is lit. Else, the pixel is dark.

**Render the image given by your program. What eight capital letters appear on your CRT?**

This bit was quite fun!

I add some class attributes as constants that represent the display, and a lit pixel:

```python
    DISPLAY_WIDTH = 40
    DISPLAY_HEIGHT = 6
    
    LIT = "#"
```

Then I initialise some additional attributes in our `__init__()` method:

```python
        self._display_posn = [0,0]
        self._display = [["." for _ in range(CrtComputer.DISPLAY_WIDTH)] 
                            for _ in range(CrtComputer.DISPLAY_HEIGHT)]
```

I.e. we set the initial pixel position to `0,0`. And we use a multi-sequence list comprehension to create a list of lists that represent the display. I.e.

- A list containing 6 rows.
- Each row is a list of 40 single character strings.
- I've set all the characters to `.`, to represent an "empty" display.

Now I create a method to render the display to the console:

```python
    def render_display(self):
        return "\n".join("".join(row) for row in self._display)
```

Again, this is just about of string joining and list comprehension, to render a single multiline string.

Now, a method that updates the display:

```python
    def _update_display(self):
        # Current horizontal pixel position being drawn
        x_posn = self._display_posn[0]
        
        # Check if horizontal position is *within* to current sprite position
        # The sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the x register gives us the middle position
        if x_posn in range(self.x-1, self.x+2):
            self._display[self._display_posn[1]][x_posn] = CrtComputer.LIT

        # display position moves across the row, then down, 
        # one pixel at a time with each tick        
        if x_posn < CrtComputer.DISPLAY_WIDTH-1:
            self._display_posn[0] += 1
        else:
            self._display_posn[0] = 0
            self._display_posn[1] += 1        
```

This code is well documented.  This is the code that checks if our current pixel is aligned with the current sprite position (given by register `x`), and if so, sets the current pixel to be lit.

We need to call `self._update_display()` with each tick. So we add this to our `tick()` method, just before increasing the cycle count:

```python
        self._update_display()
```

All done!!

    # Part 1
    interesting_cycles = [20, 60, 100, 140, 180, 220]
    signal_strength_sum = 0
    crt_computer = CrtComputer(data)
    while crt_computer.running_program:
        crt_computer.tick()
        if crt_computer.cycle in interesting_cycles:

    main()
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    print(f"Execution time: {t2 - t1:0.4f} seconds")
```

And the output looks like this:

```text

Part 2:

Execution time: 0.0010 seconds
```

That's pretty quick!

## Visualisation

The characters are not very readable!  Let's use Matplotlib to render some pretty output:

All we need to do is add this to our class:

```python
    def render_as_plt(self):
        """ Render the display as a scatter plot """
        
        all_points = [(x,y) for x in range(CrtComputer.DISPLAY_WIDTH)
                            for y in range(CrtComputer.DISPLAY_HEIGHT)
                            if self._display[y][x] == CrtComputer.LIT]
        
        x_vals, y_vals = zip(*all_points)
        
        axes = plt.gca()
        axes.set_aspect('equal')
        plt.axis("off") # hide the border around the plot axes
        axes.set_xlim(min(x_vals)-1, max(x_vals)+1)
        axes.set_ylim(min(y_vals)-1, max(y_vals)+1)
        axes.invert_yaxis()
        
        axes.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, marker="o", s=50)
        plt.show()
```

Again, it uses some multi-sequence list comprehension to obtain all the points in the display, as (x,y) coordinates. Then we use `zip(*all_points)` to transpose our `list` of `[x,y]` to become a `list` of _x values_ and a `list` of _y values_. This is explained [here](/python/zip). Then we're ready to plot!

The output looks like this:

![CRT display as plot]({{"/assets/images/crt_render_as_plt.png" | relative_url }}){:style="width: 480px"}
