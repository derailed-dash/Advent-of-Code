# Welcome to {{ page.title }}

I've been using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/){:target="_blank"} as a way to improve my Python skills. 
Here I document my solutions across the various AoC years. 
My hope is that this guide can help others to:

- Become more proficient with Python.
- Solve AoC problems they might be stuck with.
- Learn some new libraries and inventive ways of doing things.

Feel free to peruse the [source code]({{ site.github.repository_url }}){:target="_blank"} directly.

## Year Index

- [2021](./2021)
- Other years will get documented later
