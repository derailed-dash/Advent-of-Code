# Welcome to {{ page.title }}

I've been using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/){:target="_blank"} as a way to improve my Python skills. 
Here I document my solutions across the various AoC years. 
My hope is that this guide will help others to:

- Become more proficient with Python.
- Solve AoC problems they might be stuck with.
- Learn some new libraries and inventive ways of doing things.

Feel free to peruse the [source code]({{ site.github.repository_url }}){:target="_blank"} directly.

## What is Advent of Code?

An awesome coding challenge, created by Eric Wastl, released every December.
Each day in December presents a new challenge, which typically needs to be solved by writing a program.
You can solve any problem with _any language and tools you like_.

You don't have to wait until December to try your hand at AoC though. 
All the previous [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2021/events){:target="_blank"} events are available, and can be completed at _any_ time.

Each day is split into a Part 1 and a Part 2.  A star is awarded for each completed challenge.
If you get 50 stars, you save Christmas!
