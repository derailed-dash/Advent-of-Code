# Welcome to {{ page.title }}

I've been using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/){:target="_blank"} as a way to improve my [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} skills. 
Here I document my solutions across the various AoC years. 
My hope is that this guide will help others to:

- Become more proficient with Python.
- Solve AoC problems they might be stuck with.
- Learn some new libraries and inventive ways of doing things.

Use the navigation above to jump straight into an AoC year. If you're completely new to Python, check out the [Getting Started with Python](python/) page first.

## What is Advent of Code?

An awesome [coding challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about){:target="_blank"} created by Eric Wastl,
released every December. A new problem is presented each day through the month. 
Typically the best way to solve any given problem is by writing a program.
The program can be written in _any language and with any tools you like_.
You don't need to be an expert coder to do AoC; in fact, AoC is a great way to learn a programming language.

Some problems are quite trivial and can be solved quickly; 
others can be a total [PITA](https://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/PITA){:target="_blank"}.
Typically, the problems get harder as the month progresses.

You don't have to wait until December to try your hand at AoC though. 
All the previous [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2021/events){:target="_blank"} events are available, and can be completed at _any_ time.

Each day is split into a Part 1 and a Part 2.  A star is awarded for each completed challenge.
**If you get 50 stars, you save Christmas!**

## My Solutions

Feel free to peruse the [source code]({{ site.github.repository_url }}){:target="_blank"} directly.
Each day gets its own folder, which is named for some of the key Python modules and techniques used in that solution.
