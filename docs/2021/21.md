## Solution Intro

Okay, we're going to play a game of **Dirac Dice**. Part 1 was nice and easy.  Part 2 nearly broke my brain.

So, we have two _players_ (each with their own _pawn_), a single _die_, and a game board with a circular track. The track contains 10 _spaces_, marked `1` through `10`.

![Diract Board]({{"/assets/images/dirac_board.jpg" | relative_url }}){:style="width:300px"}

Players start with a score of 0. Each player starts on a random space. The starting space does not contribute to the player score. Players move clockwise, based on die rolls.  Whatever space they land on, they are awarded that score, which is added to their existing score.
