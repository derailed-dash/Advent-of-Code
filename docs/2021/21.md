## Solution Intro

Okay, we're going to play a game of **Dirac Dice**. Part 1 was nice and easy.  Part 2 nearly broke my brain.

So, we have two _players_ (each with their own _pawn_), a single _die_, and a game board with a circular track. The track contains 10 _spaces_, marked `1` through `10`.

![Diract Board]({{"/assets/images/dirac_board.jpg" | relative_url }}){:style="width:300px"}

We're told:

- Players start with a score of 0.
- Each player starts on a random space. The starting space does not contribute to the initial player score.
- Players take turns. On a player's turn, the player rolls the die 3 times.
- The sum of the die rolls is the number of spaces they move, clockwise.  Whatever space they land on, that is the score they are awarded for that turn.  This is added to their existing score.

## Part 1

We're given a _100 sided deterministic die_.  I.e. every roll of the die returns an incrementing number from `1` to `100`.  When it gets to `100`, we go back to `1`.  The game is won when a player reaches a score of at least 1000.

**What is the product of the score of the losing player and the number of times the die was rolled in the game?**

This is quite an easy problem, and we get to play with a few new things.

### Setup

Some new things here, which we'll cover as we get to them.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os
import time
from typing import Iterator, NamedTuple
from copy import deepcopy
from itertools import product

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__) 
INPUT_FILE = "input/input.txt"
# INPUT_FILE = "input/sample_input.txt"

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:\t%(message)s", 
                    datefmt='%H:%M:%S')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Solution

First, a class for the players:

```python
class Player(NamedTuple):
    """ A player has a current position on the board, and a cumulative score """
    posn: int
    score: int
```

This subclasses `NamedTuple`.  It's a lot like the more powerful `Dataclass`. It allows us to create a class which is actually a `tuple`, but where the attributes of the `tuple` can be referenced by name.

Now we'll create an _abstract_ class, called `AbstractDie`:

```python
class AbstractDie(ABC):
    """ Abstract die """
    def __init__(self, faces: int) -> None:
        self._faces = faces
        self._total_rolls = 0   # How many times have we rolled this die
        self._roll_gen = self._roll()   # A generator that performs the roll.
            
    @property
    def total_rolls(self):
        return self._total_rolls
    
    def roll(self):
        """ This is how we roll the die. Calls next() on the roll generator. """
        return next(self._roll_gen)
    
    @abstractmethod
    def _roll(self) -> Iterator[int]:
        """ We need to override this method. """
        return NotImplemented
```

The concept of an _abstract_ class is that it provides some functionality that we can reuse in subclasses, but the abstract class itself _cannot be instantiated_. This is because the _abstract_ class has one or more _abstract methods_, meaning that these methods do not yet have any actual implementation. So when we extend the abstract class, we need to provide an implementation for any _abstract methods_. In our `AbstractDie`, we can see that the `_roll()` method lacks any implementation, and is decorated as `@abstractmethod`.

Note that our `AbstractDie` class in inherits from `ABC`, i.e. the _abstract base class_.  This is what marks our class as _abstract_.

If we try to do something like this:

```python
die = AbstractDie(faces=100)
```

Then we'll get an error like this:

```text
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class AbstractDie with abstract method _roll
```

Other things to note about our `AbstractDie`:

- We pass in the number of faces, when we construct the die.
- It sets the instance variable `_roll_gen` to point to the `_roll()` method.  It expects that method to be a _generator_.  I.e. a form of iterator that returns a new object whenever the generator is passed to `next()`.
- Furthermore, we provide a public method `roll()`, which actually returns the `next()` item from our `generator`.

Now let's implement our `DeterministicDie`:

```python
class DeterministicDie(AbstractDie):
    """ Subclass of AbstractDie. Persists state between rolls.
    Always yields an incrementing int from the number of available faces, starting at 1.
    E.g. from 1-100. When we get to the number of faces, we wrap back around to 1. """
    
    def _roll(self) -> Iterator[int]:
        """ Yield the next available number. """
        while True:
            for i in range(1, self._faces+1):
                self._total_rolls += 1
                yield i
```

Nice and short.  This is a _subclass_ of `AbstractDie`, so we only need to override the _abstract method_, i.e. the `_roll()` method.  This method _yields_ incrementing values of i (i.e. from 1 to 100), and then wraps back around to 1, by virtue of being in an infinite `while True` loop. Note the use of the **yield** keyword here.  It works like a `return` statement, but allows the method execution to continue on the very next method line, when we next call the method.  E.g. if `i` has a value of `50` and we've just yielded that value, then when we next call `roll()`, which in turn calls `next()` on our `_roll()` method, then the method will continue within the `for` loop, setting `i` to `51`.

Now let's define a class for the `Game` itself:

```python
class Game():
    """ We're on a circular track, with grid numbers 1 to 10. The player moves around the circle with each go.
    If the player lands on number x, the player gains x points.
    The player starts on an arbitrary grid number, and with a score of 0. """
    SPACES = 10
    ROLLS_PER_TURN = 3    
    
    def __init__(self, players: list[Player], die: AbstractDie, target: int) -> None:
        self._players = players  # Our two players.
        self._die = die          # Our die may be deterministic, so we need to store die state
        self._target = target    # The score a player needs to reach, to win the game    
    
    @property
    def players(self):
        return self._players
    
    @property
    def die(self):
        return self._die
    
    def play(self) -> int:
        """ Play a game. Each player takes a turn, until the target score is reached by a player. """
        while True:
            for player_num in range(len(self.players)):
                score = self._take_turn(player_num)
                if score >= self._target:   # This player has won!
                    return player_num
        
        assert False, "Game should end!"
        
    def _take_turn(self, player_num: int) -> int:
        """ Takes a turn for this player.  Roll the die n (e.g. 3) times, to give score x.
        Then move around the circle x places.  Whatever we land on, that's the score returned.
        Add this to existing score. Update the player.  Returns the cumulative score of the player """

        old_posn, old_total = self.players[player_num] # unpack the player
        
        die_score = sum(self._die.roll() for i in range(Game.ROLLS_PER_TURN)) # Roll n times
        new_posn = (((old_posn + die_score)-1) % Game.SPACES) + 1 # Move forward n spaces
        new_total = old_total + new_posn  # Add new board position to existing player score
        self.players[player_num] = Player(new_posn, new_total)  # Update the player
        
        return new_total
```

When we create a new `Game`, we pass in a list of players (there will be two), a _die_ instance (which will be a subclass of `AbstractDie`), and the score we need to reach, for the game to end.

After initialisation, the game is played by calling `play()` on our `Game` instance.

- We alternate between our two players, i.e. with the current player passed to `_take_turn()`.
- Taking a turn results in the player landing on a new space, which returns a new cumulative score.  
- If the score exceeds the target (i.e. 1000), then the game ends. The winning player number is returned.

The `_take_turn()` method:

- Gets the current player position and score.
- Performs our three die rolls, and then gets the `sum` of those rolls.
- Determines the new position, by moving forward the number of spaces given the sum of the die rolls.
- Updates the player's score, based on that new position.

Finally, we run it:

```python
    input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
    with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read().splitlines()

    init_players: list[Player] = []
    for line in data:
        tokens = line.split() # Into 5 tokens, e.g. "Player" "1" "starting" "position:" "4"
        init_players.append(Player(posn=int(tokens[-1]), score=0))
    
    # Part 1
    players = deepcopy(init_players)
    die = DeterministicDie(faces=100)
    game = Game(players, die, target=1000)
    won = game.play()
    
    total_rolls = game.die.total_rolls
    logger.info("Die has been rolled %d times", total_rolls)
    logger.info("Player %d won with score of: %d", won+1, players[won].score)
    logger.info("Part 1 result = %d\n", total_rolls * min(player.score for player in game.players))
```

This is what we're doing here:

- Start by parsing the input `str` to get starting positions.  We create `Player` objects from these starting positions. We set their scores to 0.
- We then create a 100-sided `DeterministicDie`.
- We then create a new `Game` instance, passing in our players, the `DeterministicDie`, and the target score of 1000.
- Finally, we run `game.play()`.
- We can get the total number of die rolls from `game.die.total_rolls`.  I.e. `die` is a `property` of our `Game` class, and `total_rolls` is a property of our `DeterministicDie`.
- We can get the score of the losing player, by getting the `min()` `player.score` of all the players in the game.  (Of course, there are only two.)

So, Part 1 was pretty easy!

## Part 2

Well, this escalated quickly!

We now only have a 3-sided die.  It's just as well.  It's a _quantum die_. Every roll of the die splits the universe into three different universes: one for each of the possible roll outcomes!

To win, we only need to reach a score of 21.

Our objective:

**Find the player that wins in more universes; in how many universes does that player win?**

OMG.

Let's consider Player 1's first turn. On the first roll, we generate 3 universes, with roll values of 1, 2 and 3.  On roll 2, each of those universes splits into 3 more universes.  And on roll 3, each of those universes splits into 3 more universes!!  Thus, 3 rolls gives us `3`<sup>`3`</sup>` = 27` different universes per turn:

```text
Roll 1                1                 2                 3
Roll 2          1     2     3     1     2     3     1     2     3
Roll 3        1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

Sum           3 4 5 4 5 6 5 6 7 4 5 6 5 6 7 6 7 8 5 6 7 6 7 8 7 8 9
```

To determine the 27 different different sums that are achievable from our 3 rolls programmatically, we can use a _cartesian product_:

```python
TRIPLE_ROLL_SUMS = [sum(score) for score in product(range(1, 4), repeat=3)] 
```

Here, we're using another handy utility from the `itertools` package. This is asking for the cartesian product of `(1, 2, 3)(1, 2, 3)(1, 2, 3)`. It's a shorthand for doing a nested for loop 3 times.

The result is:

`[3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9]`

Great. Those are the different 3-roll die sums for the 27 different universes of the first move of the game.  If player 2 now takes their turn, they have 27 different universes that follow each of the universes created by player 1.  Thus, with two turns, we have `27*27 = 729` universes. After three turns, there are nearly 20000 universes. After four turns, half a million universes.  After 5 turns, 14 million universes.  You can see that this is going to get rapidly out of hand.

In theory, if both players were only ever rolling a score of `1` with their die, you could envisage a game that takes 14 turns to finish (i.e. 7 turns each, with each turn having a cumulative roll score of 3). That would result in 109418989131512359209 universes.  Way too many to process!

So, what's our game plan?

Clearly we can't simulate every possible universe.  The solution space is just too large. But it turns out there aren't that many different game states. And from any given game state, we just need to work out how many ways there are to win from _that state_.  But what is a _game state_?

A game state is represented by:

- The position of the player on the board; there are only 10 different positions (`1` through `10`) per player.
- The score of the player; there are only 21 different scores (`0` through `20`, since any larger score results in the game ending) per player.

Thus, we have `10*10*21*21 = 44100` game states. That means only 44100 _unique universes_ from which a player can win.  Clearly, there are a lot more possible universes than that.  But it doesn't matter, since we can cache game states we've seen before, and whenever we see a previous game state, we know exactly how many ways there are to win from that game state.

So now we can solve using _recursion_. Recall from [Day 14](14) that to implement recursion, we need:

- A base case, where the function simply returns a value.
- Any other cases, where the function calls itself, and where each call moves closer to the base case.

We'll create a function that determines how many ways each player can win from the _current game state_. This is called `count_wins()`.

So what's our base case? This is the case where we've reached our goal, and the function should exit. We've reached our goal when either player has won. Either player has won when their score is >= 21. So if Player A has >= 21, then there is 1 way that Player A can win, and 0 ways that Player B can win. (Since Player A has won.) And if Player B has >= 21, there is 1 way that Player B can win, and 0 ways that Plaer A can win.

In all other cases, we want to determine our 27 different triple roll outcomes possible for this player, move the player the appropriate number of spaces, and update the player's score; thus creating a new game state. Then we recurse into our function with this new game state. But crucially, when we recurse, we swap the player A and player B positions as parameters to the function call, since if Player A took the last turn, then Player B needs to take this turn.

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)    
def count_wins(posn_a: int, posn_b: int, score_a: int, score_b: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """ Return number of universes in which each player can win from this state.
    With a given game state, player a starts at posn_a with score_a and player b at posn_b with score_b.
    Player a's turn.

    Returns:
        tuple[int, int]: (Ways to win for player a, ways to win for player b)
    """
    if score_a >= 21:
        return (1, 0)   # Player A has won; player B has lost. No other options are possible.
    
    if score_b >= 21:
        return (0, 1)   # Player B has won; player A has lost. No other options are possible.
    
    wins_a = wins_b = 0  # Initialise; no wins yet
    
    # Perform the triple roll to get a new game state, and then handover to other player to take their turn
    for score in TRIPLE_ROLL_SUMS:  # 27 differnet recursions for this turn
        new_posn_a = (posn_a + score - 1) % Game.SPACES + 1     # move player
        new_score_a = score_a + new_posn_a                      # update player score
        
        # Now recurse. Next move is from player b. So, next call will return (ways b, ways a).
        wins_b_from_here, wins_a_from_here = count_wins(posn_b, new_posn_a, score_b, new_score_a)
        wins_a += wins_a_from_here
        wins_b += wins_b_from_here
        
    return wins_a, wins_b
```

The last point to note is the addition of the _decorator_ `@lru_cache()`. This implements a _least recently used_ cache, such that when the function is given a set of parameters that have been used before (i.e. a previously seen game state), then the function returns the same result as it did before, without actually doing any work. Thus, the function is caching previously seen states, including all the recursions that a given state would have needed to process. We pass `maxsize=None` to the `@lru_cache()` decorator, such that there's no limit on the number of parameter permutations that are cached.

This combination of recursion, combined with caching the results of a call we've seen before, is called **memoization**.

We call the code, as follows:

```python
   # Part 2
    # With a given game state, player_1 starts at posn_1 with score_1and player_2 at posn_2 with score_2.
    # How many ways can they win from this state?
    players = deepcopy(init_players)
    wins = count_wins(players[0].posn, players[1].posn, players[0].score, players[1].score)
    for i, win in enumerate(wins):
        logger.info("Player %d wins: %d", i+1, win)
        
    logger.info("Part 2: universes in which the player wins the most = %d", max(wins))
```

And the output looks like this:

```text
21:57:08.588:INFO:__main__:     Die has been rolled 861 times
21:57:08.590:INFO:__main__:     Player 1 won with score of: 1008

21:57:08.799:INFO:__main__:     Execution time: 0.2135 seconds
```

Wow, that's a lot of universes!
