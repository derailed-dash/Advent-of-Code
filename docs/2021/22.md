## Solution Intro

I've got to admit... At this point in my 2021 AoC journey, I was starting to feel a little grumpy about how much time these challenges were taking.  My original expectation was that I'd have most days done by breakfast, and there might be one or two tough days.  But at this point, I'm writing off half my annual leave to solving AoC problems. Urgh.

Anyhoo...

We're told we need to reboot the sub's reactor.  And the reactor is made up of a massive 3D grid of one-unit cubes, where cubes can be `on` or `off`.

We need to follow a reboot sequence, which is a set of `on` or `off` instructions, which each instruction followed by `x`, `y`, and `z` ranges that describe a cuboid.  I.e. an `on` instruction will turn all the cubes on, in the 3D cuboid region described by the instruction.  And, obviously, an `off` instruction will turn them all off.

Our sample input looks like this:

```text
on x=-5..47,y=-31..22,z=-19..33
on x=-44..5,y=-27..21,z=-14..35
on x=-49..-1,y=-11..42,z=-10..38
on x=-20..34,y=-40..6,z=-44..1
off x=26..39,y=40..50,z=-2..11
on x=-41..5,y=-41..6,z=-36..8
off x=-43..-33,y=-45..-28,z=7..25
on x=-33..15,y=-32..19,z=-34..11
off x=35..47,y=-46..-34,z=-11..5
on x=-14..36,y=-6..44,z=-16..29
on x=-57795..-6158,y=29564..72030,z=20435..90618
```

## Part 1

**Considering only cubes in the region `x=-50..50,y=-50..50,z=-50..50`, how many cubes are on after following the reboot sequence?**

It's pretty obvious what Part 2 is going to say. &lt;sigh&gt;

Well, I started off by doing it the obvious way, hoping (foolishly) that it might scale for Part 2.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
import logging
import os
import time
import re
from typing import NamedTuple

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:\t%(message)s", 
                    datefmt='%H:%M:%S')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__) 
# INPUT_FILE = "input/input.txt"
INPUT_FILE = "input/sample_input.txt"

class Instruction(NamedTuple):
    """ An instruction to turn on/off all the cubes in the region described by the Cuboid """
    on_or_off: str
    cuboid: Cuboid

class Cuboid(NamedTuple):
    """ Stores the x, y and z coordinates that make up a cuboid. """
    x_range: tuple[int, int]
    y_range: tuple[int, int]
    z_range: tuple[int, int]
```

Not much to say about that.  I'm using a `NamedTuple` for both the `Instruction` class, and for the `Cuboid` class.  This just makes them a bit more readable.

Now I'll create a class that reprents the `Reactor`:

```python
class Reactor():
    """ 3D space that contains a number of unit cubes. Initially, all cubes are turned off.
    We process a number of instructions, which toggles cuboid regions to be on or off. """
    
    def __init__(self, bound:int=0) -> None:
        """ Initialise this cuboid set.  When adding / subtracting points (later), ignore anything out of bounds. 
        Bound is given by (0-bound, 0+bound) in any dimension. 0 means no bound. """
        self._bound = bound
        self._cuboid = set()
        
    @property
    def cells_on(self):
        return len(self._cuboid)
    
    def update(self, instr:Instruction):
        """ Turn on / off points that are supplied in the form of a Cuboid. """
        cuboid = self._cuboid_to_set(instr.cuboid.x_range, instr.cuboid.y_range, instr.cuboid.z_range)
        
        if instr.on_or_off == "on":
            self._cuboid = self._cuboid | cuboid   # union
        else:
            self._cuboid = self._cuboid - cuboid   # diff
    
    def _cuboid_to_set(self, x_range: tuple, y_range: tuple, z_range: tuple) -> set:
        """ Creates a new set of 'on' points, given a set of 3 pairs of cuboid vertices. """
        temp_cuboid = set()
        
        x_lower, x_upper = x_range[0], x_range[1]
        y_lower, y_upper = y_range[0], y_range[1]
        z_lower, z_upper = z_range[0], z_range[1]
        
        if self._bound > 0:
            x_lower = max(x_lower, -self._bound)
            y_lower = max(y_lower, -self._bound)
            z_lower = max(z_lower, -self._bound)
            
            x_upper = min(x_upper, self._bound)
            y_upper = min(y_upper, self._bound)
            z_upper = min(z_upper, self._bound)

        for x in range(x_lower, x_upper+1):
            for y in range(y_lower, y_upper+1):
                for z in range(z_lower, z_upper+1):
                    temp_cuboid.add((x, y, z))
        
        return temp_cuboid
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"CuboidGrid:size={len(self._cuboid)}"
```

Things to note about this:

- Internally, it stores all `on` cubes as a `set`.
- Thus, the number of cubes turned `on` is given by the size of the `set`.
- It updates the number of `on` cubes in the reactor, by processing instructions, one instruction at a time.
- For each instruction:

  - We create a `set` that contains all the cubes described by the cuboid of this instruction.
  - We restrict the cubes in this `set` to be cubes that sit within the bounds, if we passed any. (Which, for Part 1, we did.)
  - If we're turning cubes `on`, we simply `union` all the cubes in the instruction's cuboid with the cubes that are already on.
  - Otherwise, we're turning the cubes `off`, so subtract all the cubes in the instruction's cuboid from teh cubes that are already on.

To run it, we first read in all the instructions and split them into lines:

```python
input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
    data = f.read().splitlines()
```

Then we convert each line into an `Instruction` object.

```python
instructions: list[Instruction] = []
pattern = re.compile(r"(on|off) x=(-?\d+)..(-?\d+),y=(-?\d+)..(-?\d+),z=(-?\d+)..(-?\d+)")
for line in data:
    if (match := pattern.match(line)):
        instr, x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max = match.groups()
        reactor = Cuboid((int(x_min), int(x_max)), (int(y_min), int(y_max)), (int(z_min), int(z_max)))
        instructions.append(Instruction(instr, reactor))
```

This works by:

- Using `regex` to obtain capture groups that represent:
  - Whether `on` or `off` (`instr`)
  - The x start (`x_min`) and x end (`x_max`)
  - The y start (`y_min`) and y end (`y_max`)
  - The z start (`z_min`) and z end (`z_max`)
  - Note that each numeric capture group contains `-?` to allow for optional negative numbers.
- We create a `Cuboid` from the `x`, `y`, and `z` ranges.
- We add the `Instruction` to the `list` of instructions.

Finally, we create our `Reactor` object, with the required bounds, and then process each `Instruction`:

```python
# Part 1 - Count how many cubes are on, with small bounds
reactor = Reactor(bound=50)
for i, instr in enumerate(instructions):
    logger.debug("Processing instruction %d; there are %d left", i+1, len(instructions)-(i+1))
    reactor.update(instr)

logger.info("Part 1 using CuboidSet - cubes on: %s\n", reactor.cells_on)
```

So that works, and it gives the right answer.  Alas, it takes over 10 seconds, which doesn't bode well for Part 2.

## Part 2

**Now we need to run the reboot steps for all cubes in the reactor, not just the ones within the +/-50 ranges.**

The instructions tell us that with just the sample data, we end up with 2758514936282235 cubes turned on.  That number is just too big to tackle with the same approach.  Given that the same sample data only has 547648 `on` cubes for Part 1, even if my computer had enough RAM, and if the application scaled linearly, I'd still be waiting for many years before the program finishes. We're going to need to be more clever.

My solution is to use **coordinate compression**. This is a technique where we take a large number of coordinates, and compress them down to fewer coordinates by eliminating all adjacent points where nothing interesting happens. As a really noddy example in one dimension:

![Coordinate Compression]({{"/assets/images/coord-compression.png" | relative_url }}){:style="width:500px"}

Here, we've taken 18 unit sized regions, which could be represented as `x=0` through to `x=17`.  We've then compressed the data, by ignoring any x values where nothing changes.  This leaves us with only 9 regions that carry any useful information, i.e. where `x` is `0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16`.

How might we apply this to our reactor problem?  Well, let's start by simplifying our reactor to one dimension.  Here's a simple 1D reactor example:

![1D Reactor]({{"/assets/images/1d-reactor-compression.png" | relative_url }}){:style="width:500px"}

Note how we only _mark_ coordinates where there are instructions that mark the beginning and end of a range. (In my code, I call these ranges _intervals_.)

How about a 2D example?

![2D Reactor]({{"/assets/images/2d-reactor-compression.png" | relative_url }}){:style="width:500px"}

How does it work?

- Take all the x and y coordinates _in the instructions_, and assemble all the x values in ascending order, and all the y values in ascending order.
- The deltas between successive values in each list represent the size of all the intervals, in that particular dimension.
- Then we can apply in the instructions, in _instruction order_.  

The algorithm for coordinate compression works like this:


- Replace each coordinate with its rank in the sorted list.
