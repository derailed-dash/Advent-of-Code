## Solution Intro

There are some people in the world - out of the roughly 200,000 that took part in the 2021 AoC - that managed to complete the solutions to this challenge in under 30 minutes!

![AoC 2021 Day 18 Leaderboard]({{"/assets/images/AoC_day18_leaderboard.jpg" | relative_url }}){:style="width:600px"}

_I'm not one of those people_.  This was tricky, and it took me hours!

I created two solutions to this problem:

- [Solution #1](#solution-1) - Converting to a `str` and then doing lots of `str` manipulation
- [Solution #2](#solution-2) - By building a binary tree, and then navigating the tree using depth-first search

So, we need to help a snailfish with its math homework.  Snailfish math is pretty darn weird. The input looks like this:

```
[[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
[[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]
[6,[[[6,2],[5,6]],[[7,6],[4,7]]]]
[[[6,[0,7]],[0,9]],[4,[9,[9,0]]]]
[[[7,[6,4]],[3,[1,3]]],[[[5,5],1],9]]
[[6,[[7,3],[3,2]]],[[[3,8],[5,7]],4]]
[[[[5,4],[7,7]],8],[[8,3],8]]
[[9,3],[[9,9],[6,[4,9]]]]
[[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
[[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]
```

- Each line is a _snailfish number_.
- Snailfish numbers can be added together. This is effectively the concatenation of two lists, followed by _reduction_.
- Snailfish _reduction_ is the repetition of the first available step on this list, until no more _reduction_ can be done.
  1. _Exploding_ of any pairs nested inside four pairs.
    - Exploding removes an inner bracket and adds the inner numbers to either side.
    - It has the effect of reducing the overall list depth by 1.
  1. _Splitting_ of any regular number that is `10` or greater, into a pair.
    - Essentially, it splits an `int` into a pair `(x,y)` of two integer halves.
    - It creates a new bracketed pair `(x,y)` from a regular number, one level deeper than the original number.

The thing which caught me out for a while is that I hadn't fully understood the _explode_ instructions.  In particular:

  - Add the left number in the pair to the nearest left number (if there is one)
  - Add the right number in the pair to the nearest right number (if there is one)
  - **AND replace the original pair with 0.**

## Part 1

**What is the highest y position it reaches on this trajectory?**

Okay, this is simple enough.  Essentially, we need to lob the probe up in an arc. We're looking for the arc that hits the target area, and reaches the highest point. Okay, it might not be an _actual arc_, since our horizontal movement might stop whilst it's still going up. I.e. it might still be going _up_, whilst not moving _out_.  And that won't look much like an arc!

Here's the game plan:

- Establish our target area, with corners _top_left_, _top_right_, _bottom_right_, _bottom_left_. 
- Create a formula to calculate velocity at step t, given an initial velocity.
- Then, loop through a range of initial velocities, with:
  - x from 0 to x_right, since we can only fire right, towards the target.
  - y from bottom_y to abs(bottom_y), since we can fire both down towards the target, but also up.
  - Then loop infinitely through steps, and determine x,y locations at each step.
    - Store max y achieved in this loop so far.
    - Build a dict of {init vel: max y} for any init velocities that hit the target.
  - Return the max y overall.

### Setup

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
import logging
from pathlib import Path
import time
import re
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:\t%(message)s", 
                    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
# INPUT_FILE = "input/input.txt"
INPUT_FILE = "input/sample_input.txt"

RENDER = True
OUTPUT_DIR = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "output/")
OUTPUT_FILE = Path(OUTPUT_DIR, "trajectory.png")
```

- I've included `matplotlib`, as I want to visually plot the trajectories. (You don't have to, obviously!)
- I've included `re`, as I'm going to parse the input data with regular expressions.

### Solution

First, some simple classes:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    x: int
    y: int

class Velocity(Point):
    """ A vector represented as (x, y) values """
    
@dataclass
class Rect():
    """ Rectangle from four corner Points, and knows whether a given point is enclosed by this rectangle """
    left_x: int
    right_x: int
    bottom_y: int
    top_y: int

    def encloses(self, point:Point) -> bool:
        return (self.left_x <= point.x <= self.right_x 
                and self.bottom_y <= point.y <= self.top_y)
        
    def as_polygon(self) -> tuple[list, list]:
        """ Convert to set of polygon points, in the order tl, tr, br, bl, 
        and returned as (list of x coords, list of y coords) """
        return ([self.left_x, self.right_x, self.right_x, self.left_x],
                [self.top_y, self.top_y, self.bottom_y, self.bottom_y])
```

Notes on these:

- `Point` is simple enough. It's an immutable dataclass.
- `Velocity` subclasses `Point`.  In fact, our `Velocity` class is identical to `Point`.  But I think it's conceptually easier to be able to work with both points, and velocities.  But at the end of the day, both classes simple have x and y values.
- `Rect` represents a rectangle, as four corner points. 
  - The `encloses()` method is what we'll use to check whether a probe is in the target area (rectangle).
  - The `as_polygon()` method returns our four corners as a clockwise list of all the corner x values (starting top left), and a clockwise list of all the corner y values (also starting top left). I use this when I'm rendering the rectangle in matplotlib.

Now our function to determine the velocity at any time, given an initial velocity:

```python
def velocity_at_step(init: Velocity, t: int) -> Velocity:
    """ Returns the velocity (x,y) at a given step. """
    x = abs(init.x) - t if t < init.x else 0  # shrinks towards 0
    y = init.y - t  # always decreases towards -ve infinity
    
    return Velocity(x, y)
```

Now let's read the data.

```python
input_file = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
    data = f.read().strip()

# Note that x and y values can be -ve
match = re.search(r"x=(-?\d+)\.\.(-?\d+), y=(-?\d+)\.\.(-?\d+)", data)
assert match, "Don't expect invalid input data"
target = Rect(*map(int, match.groups()))
logger.info(target)
```

- We start by reading in the input as a `str`.
- Then we use `re.search()` to match a number of _groups_ in the `str. If you're not too familiar with regex patterns, then this pattern works like this:
  - It starts by looking for a `str` that matches: "`x=(number)..(number), y=(number)..(number)`".
  - The four individual _groups_ are denoted by brackets.
  - Each number is determined using "`-?\d+`", which means _optional_ "`-`", followed by a compulsory number, made up one or more digits. The "`-?`" is necessary, since our numbers could be negative.
  - To represent "`..`" we have to escape each dot using "`\.`", because the "`.`" character is otherwise interpreted as an _any_ character placeholder by the regex parser.
  - If you want to test your regular expressions as you build them, consider using the very awesome [Regexr.com](https://regexr.com/){:target="_blank"}.
- We then `assert` that a match was found, as we always expect it to be.
- We then use `map()` to convert each item of `groups()` to an `int`, and we pass the four `int` values to our `Rect` constructor.  This is how we construct the rectangle target area.

And now we can test out some trajectories!

```python
successful_peaks = {}    # init_velocity: peak
highest_trajectory = []
max_y = 0
for x in range(1, target.right_x+1):   # No point having x larger than max target distance
    for y in range(target.bottom_y, abs(target.bottom_y)):   # remember we can fire up
        init_v = Velocity(x, y)
        hit, trajectory = evaluate_trajectory(target, init_v)
        if hit:     # if this was a good trajectory to hit the target
            this_max_y = max(point.y for point in trajectory) 
            successful_peaks[init_v] = this_max_y  # store the heighest point for this init_v               
            if this_max_y > max_y:  # If this trajectory has given a new highest point
                highest_trajectory = trajectory
                max_y = this_max_y             

logger.info("Max peak=%d", max_y)
```

This works as follows:

- We need to start with some reasonable bounds of initial `x,y` velocities to try.  I've gone with trying all initial `x` between 0 and the right edge of the target area, and all initial `y` between the value of the bottom of the target area, and the same value in the upwards direction.
- For each initial `Velocity x,y`:
  - Try this velocity, and see if it hits the target area.  If it does, we return the successful trajectory, in the form of every point the probe crossed up until and including when it arrived in the target area.
  - Store the maximum `y` for all the points in this trajectory, i.e. the highest point reached by the probe.
  - Store this maximum `y` in a dict using a key of the _initial velocity_.  I.e. to build up a dictionary of every peak for every successful initial velocity.
  - If this `y` was higher than the `y` of any previous trajectory, then store this trajectory as the `highest_trajectory`.

We then print the highest `y` that was reached, in order to solve Part 1.

Finally, we just need to implement the function that actually builds a trajectory for an initial velocity, and determine if this trajectory hits the target area.  This is our `evaluate_trajectory()` function:

```python
def evaluate_trajectory(target: Rect, initial_v: Velocity) -> tuple[bool, list[Point]]:
    """ Given a target region to hit and an initial velocity, 
    determine if we will hit the target on any step.

    Args:
        target (Rect): Region we need to hit
        initial_v (Velocity): Initial x, y velocity at t=0

    Returns:
        tuple[bool, list[Point]]: Whether trajectory hit the target, and the path taken.
    """
    t = 0
    location = Point(0,0)  # Where we launch our probe from
    trajectory: list[Point] = [location]
    hit_target = False
    
    while not hit_target:
        vel = velocity_at_step(initial_v, t)
        location = Point(location.x + vel.x, location.y + vel.y)
        trajectory.append(location)            
                
        if (vel.x == 0 and location.x < target.left_x):
            break   # we're just going to fall downwards from here.
                
        if location.x > target.right_x or location.y < target.bottom_y:
            break   # we've overshot the target
                
        if target.encloses(location): # If we've hit the target
            hit_target = True
            break

        # If we're here, we haven't yet reached the target
        t += 1
        
    return hit_target, trajectory
```

This works by:

- Set initial location to `Point(0,0)`.
- Create a `list` to store all `Points` in this _trajectory_, including the initial location.
- While we haven't hit the target:
  - Determine the `Velocity` at this step.
  - Determine the new location by adding the current `Velocity` to the last location `Point`.
  - Add the `Point` to our _trajectory_ `list`.
  - If the current `Velocity` is 0 in the `x` direction and the current location is left of the target region, then we'll never reach the target region, i.e. because we can't move further right.  So break.
  - If the current location is right of target region, or below the target region, then we've overshot. So break.
  - If we've hit the target, then exit the loop.
- Finally, return the `tuple` of whether we hit the target, and the _trajectory_.

## Part 2

**We're asked to count how many distinct initial velocities will allow our probe to hit the target area after any step.**

Good news!  We've already done this! We previously created a dictionary that stored the peak for every successful initial velocity. So we just need to count how many successful initial velocities there were.

```python
logger.info("Count of valid shots=%d", len(successful_peaks))
```

The final output looks like this:

```
2022-01-24 21:39:11.557:INFO:__main__:  Rect(left_x=153, right_x=199, bottom_y=-114, top_y=-75)
2022-01-24 21:39:12.239:INFO:__main__:  Max peak=6441
2022-01-24 21:39:12.239:INFO:__main__:  Count of valid shots=3186
2022-01-24 21:39:12.653:INFO:__main__:  Plot saved to c:\Users\djl\localdev\Python\Advent-of-Code\src\AoC_2021\d17_probe_trajectory_re_points\output\trajectory.png   
2022-01-24 21:39:12.654:INFO:__main__:  Execution time: 0.3965 seconds
```

Phew!  That was easy!!

## Plotting the Trajectory

Just for kicks, let's visually plot the trajectory.

```python
if RENDER:
    plot_trajectory(highest_trajectory, target) # show the plot    
else:
    plot_trajectory(highest_trajectory, target, OUTPUT_FILE) # save the plot


def plot_trajectory(trajectory: list[Point], target: Rect, outputfile=None):
    """ Render this trajectory as a plot, and optionally save it """
    axes = plt.gca()
    
    # Add axis lines at x=0 and y=0
    plt.axhline(0, color='green')
    plt.axvline(0, color='green') 
    axes.grid(True) # grid lines on
    
    # Set up titles
    axes.set_title("Trajectory")
    axes.set_xlabel("Horizontal")
    axes.set_ylabel("Height")
    
    axes.fill(*target.as_polygon(), 'cyan')  # add the target area
    plt.annotate("TARGET", (target.left_x, target.top_y), 
                 xytext=(target.left_x + ((target.right_x - target.left_x)/2)-2, 
                        (target.top_y - (target.top_y-target.bottom_y)/2)-1), 
                 color="blue", weight='bold') 
    
    # Plot the trajectory points
    all_x = [point.x for point in trajectory]
    all_y = [point.y for point in trajectory]
    plt.plot(all_x, all_y, marker="o", markerfacecolor="red", markersize=4, color='black')
    
    x, y = trajectory[1].x, trajectory[1].y
    plt.annotate(f"Vel {x},{y}", (x,y), xytext=(x-3, y+2))  # label first point
    x, y = [(point.x, point.y) for point in trajectory if point.y == max(point.y for point in trajectory)][0]
    plt.annotate(f"({x},{y})", (x,y), xytext=(x+1, y-1))  # label highest point    
        
    if outputfile:
        dir_path = Path(outputfile).parent
        if not Path.exists(dir_path):
            Path.mkdir(dir_path)
        plt.savefig(outputfile)
        logger.info("Plot saved to %s", outputfile)        
    else:
        plt.show()
```

- I use `RENDER` to set whether we should _show_ the visualisation interactively, or whether to save it as a file. If we're saving as a file, we need to pass the file as a parameter.  If not, then the output file parameter defaults to `None`.
- We obtain the plot area using Matplotlib's `plot.gca()`.
- We add axis lines that pass through the origin.
- We add some grid lines.
- We add a title and label the axes.
- We then add a filled polygon, passing in `x` list and `y` list, as created using `as_polygon()` from our `Rect` object.
- We add an _annotation_, i.e. text, which sits within the rectangle area.
- We then use `plt.plot()` to create a `line` plot for all points in the trajectory.
- We then add further _annotations_, i.e. labels for the initial velocity, and for the highest point.

With the sample data, the output looks like this:

![Probe Trajectory]({{"/assets/images/trajectory.png" | relative_url }}){:style="width:600px"}

And with the actual data:

![Probe Trajectory]({{"/assets/images/trajectory_actual.png" | relative_url }}){:style="width:600px"}

## Gorillas!

Gorillas is a game two gorillas each throw bananas at each other. The goal is to hit the other gorilla with the banana. You play one of the gorillas. When you take your turn, you have to establish an angle and a velocity. So, it's a lot like our probe trajectories!

I first played Gorillas on a 386 PC in the early 90s.  Gorillas came as source code, with the _QBasic_ language that was shipped with MSDOS.

If you want to play it, you can pop over to [Classic Reload](https://classicreload.com/qbasic-gorillas.html){:target="_blank"} and play it on your browser!
