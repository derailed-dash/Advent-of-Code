## Solution Intro

OMG!  It's Christmas day.

It was a relief that this problem was easy to solve. I've got presents to open!!  I say easy... Not completely trivial, and there is at least one _gotcha_.

## Overview

We need to land our sub on the seafloor. But the seafloor is covered in sea cucumbers.  Specifically, there are two herds of cucumbers:

- One herd is migrating directly east, `>`.
- One herd is migrating directly south, `v`.

Our input data is map of the starting locations of these migrating sea cucumbers. E.g.

```text
v...>>.vv>
.vv>>.vv..
>>.>v>...v
>>v>>.>.v.
v>v.vv.v..
>.>>..v...
.vv..>.>v.
v.v..>>v.v
....v..v.>
```

The grid uses `.` to denote empty spaces.

The migration rules:

- With each step:
  - All the cucumbers of the east herd migrate - simultaneously - one step, if they're not blocked. Because they all move simultaneoulsy, only consider whether they're blocked _before_ they all move. For this reason, if we take this row: \
  `v...>>.vv>` \
  The next position after east migration is:
  `v...>.>vv>` \
  The next position after east migration is **not**:
  `v....>>vv>`
  - Then, all the cucumbers of the south herd migrate - simultaneously - one step, if they're not blocked.
- If a cucumber migrates off the right edge or bottom edge, they miraculously reappear on the opposite edge.

## Part 1

**What is the first step on which no sea cucumbers move?**

The cucumbers will stop moving when they're all blocked.

I'll create a `Grid` class, that represents all the sea cucumber locations, and can simulate their movement with each step:

```python
class Grid():
    """ Store locations of sea cucumbers. """
   
    def __init__(self, data: list[str]) -> None:
        """ Take input data and convert from list-of-str to list-of-list for easier manipulation. """
        self._grid = [list(row) for row in data]    # Now a nested list of list.
        self._row_len = len(self._grid[0])
        self._grid_len = len(self._grid)
        self._changed_last_cycle = True
    
    @property
    def changed_last_cycle(self):
        return self._changed_last_cycle

    def cycle(self):
        """ Performs a migration cycle for our east-moving and south-moving herds 
        Performs all east, and then performs all south. Then updates the grid. """
        self._changed_last_cycle = False
        
        # Make a copy of the grid.  Shallow copy won't work, as we have a nested list. Deepcopy is too slow.
        tmp_grid = [[self._grid[y][x] for x in range(self._row_len)] for y in range(self._grid_len)]
        
        # process east herd, row by row
        for y in range(self._grid_len):
            for x in range(self._row_len):
                next_x = (x+1)%self._row_len  # get right / wrap-around
                if self._grid[y][x] + self._grid[y][next_x] == ">.":
                    tmp_grid[y][x] = "."
                    tmp_grid[y][next_x] = ">"
                    self._changed_last_cycle = True
        
        self._grid = tmp_grid
        
        east_migrated = [[tmp_grid[y][x] for x in range(self._row_len)] for y in range(self._grid_len)]
                
        for y in range(self._grid_len):
            for x in range(self._row_len):
                next_y = (y+1)%self._grid_len  # get below / wrap-around
                if tmp_grid[y][x] + tmp_grid[next_y][x] == "v.":
                    east_migrated[y][x] = "."
                    east_migrated[next_y][x] = "v"
                    self._changed_last_cycle = True
        
        self._grid = east_migrated
        
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "\n".join("".join(char for char in row) for row in self._grid)
```

This is how it works:

- Take the input data - as a `list` of `str` - convert it to a `list` of `lists`, and store in the instance variable `_grid`.
- Determine `_row_len` from the length of the first row.
- Determine `_grid_len` from the number of rows in the grid.
- Expose whether the grid changed in the last cycle, through the `property` called `changed_last_cycle`.
- All the work is done in the `cycle()` method, which is exposed by the class:
  - First, set `_changed_last_cycle` to `False`.
  - Now make a copy of the current grid. We do this using nested `list comprehension`, which is much faster than using the `deepcopy()` method. We need a copy, because we always need to evaluate each existing cucumber positions based on the grid configuration at the start of the cycle; but we need to be updating the new configuration one cucumber at a time.
  - Now iterate through each row.
    - Iterate through each character position in the row, from left to right.
      - We note that the current horizontal cucumber position is given by `x`, and the next horizontal cucumber position is given by `next_x`. Crucially, `next_x` is equivalent to `(x+1) % row_len`, to allow for the next position wrapping over to the left.
      - Then we look for all `">."`, since these represent location pairs where a cucumber can migrate one space to the east. Wherever we find this:
        - Set these two characters to be `".>"` in the new copy.
        - Set `_changed_last_cycle` to `True`.
  - Once we exit the above loop, east migration has completed.  So make a new copy of the current state of the herds.
  - As above, iterate through each row.
    - Iterate through horizontal cucumber positions.
      - This time compute the next `y` position, allowing for the next position to roll around back to the top.
      - Now look for `"v."` at each horizontal position, across pairs of rows. If we find any:
        - Change to `".v"` in the new copy.
        - Set `_changed_last_cycle` to `True`.
  - All migration has now completed. Update the Grid's `_grid` attribute to reflect the current state.

Now we just need to read in the data, construct a `Grid` class from it, then `cycle` our `Grid` until there are no more changes:

```python
with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
    data = f.read().splitlines()

grid = Grid(data)

i = 0
while grid.changed_last_cycle:
    i += 1
    grid.cycle()

logger.info("We've stopped migrating at iteration %d", i)
```

It works!!  Hurrah!

```text
22:57:03.946:DEBUG:__main__:    Created Grid
22:57:06.336:INFO:__main__:     We've stopped migrating at iteration 360
22:57:06.336:INFO:__main__:     Execution time: 2.3969 seconds
```

## Part 2

There's nothing to do.  Turns out we've **saved Christmas!!**

Woop, woop!!

## Visualisation

It would be great to build an animation to visualise our migrating sea cucumber herds. Here's my strategy for building the animation:

- For each cycle:
  - Use **Matplotlib** to plot the cucumber positions on the grid, in the form of a pretty scatter plot.
  - Save one frame for the east migration, and another frame for the south migration.
- Finally, use **ImageIO** to assemble all the frames into a single animation gif file.

Here's our modified `Grid` class:

```python
class Grid():
    """ Store locations of sea cucumbers. """
   
    def __init__(self, data: list[str], animator: Animator=None) -> None:
        """ Take input data and convert from list-of-str to list-of-list for easier manipulation. """
        init_str = "Created Grid"
        if animator:
            init_str += " with Animator"
        logger.debug(init_str)
        
        self._grid = [list(row) for row in data]    # Now a nested list of list.
        self._row_len = len(self._grid[0])
        self._grid_len = len(self._grid)
        self._changed_last_cycle = True
        
        self._animator = animator
        self._plot_info = self.setup_fig()  # does no work if no Animator
        self._render_frame()
    
    @property

        return self._changed_last_cycle

    def cycle(self):
        """ Performs a migration cycle for our east-moving and south-moving herds 
        Performs all east, and then performs all south. Then updates the grid. """
        self._changed_last_cycle = False
        
        # Make a copy of the grid.  Shallow copy won't work, as we have a nested list. Deepcopy is too slow.

        # process east herd, row by row
        for y in range(self._grid_len):
            for x in range(self._row_len):

                if self._grid[y][x] + self._grid[y][next_x] == ">.":

```

- Changes to the `__init__()` method:
  - It now takes a new optional argument, called `animator`. 
    - If we pass an `Animator` object, then we'll render the animation.
      - We'll store it in the Grid's `_animator` instance variable.
      - We call `setup_fig()` to do some initialisation for Matplotlib.
      - We generate an initial frame, to represent the initial state of the `Grid`. 

- Changes to the `cycle()` method:
  - This now calls `_render_frame()` at the end of the east migration, and at the end of the south migration. Thus, adding two new frames per cycle.

- The new `setup_fig()` method:
  - Establishes the size of the plot, in pixels. This will be the size of our rendered frames, e.g. 1024x768 pixels.
  - Hides the x and y axes.
  - Sets the face colour of the plot to orange.
  - Sets the x and y axis limits to be an extra 0.5 outside the grid. E.g. if the x axis went from 0 to 10, then this would set the limits to be -0.5 and 10.5 
  - We then dynamically compute a marker size, which we'll use to represent each sea cucumber. The bigger the grid in the input data, the smaller the marker size will be.

- The new `_render_frame()` method:
  - Is private to the `Grid` class.
  - If our `Grid` has no `Animator`, then this method immediately returns.  Else...
  - Store `(x,y)` tuples for each east cucumber in an `east` set.
  - Store `(x,y)` tuples for each south cucumber in a `south` set.
  - Use `zip()` to turn each set of `(x,y)` tuples in a tuple of all `x` values, and a tuple of all `y` values. (Matplotlib needs the coordinates to be passed in this format.)
  - Plot the scatters:
    - Using black `>` markers for the east cucumbers.
    - Using white `v` markets for the south cucumbers.
  - Now we can use `plt.savefig()` to save our plot as a file. My first version of this animation actually saved each frame as a file, requiring me to stich the frames together, and then delete these _temporary_ files. But instead, we can save to an _in-memory_ BytesIO object; essentially, an in-memory file. This turns out to be an order of magnitude faster, even though I was writing my temporary files to an SSD.

Then I created an `Animator` class, to do the job of storing our frames, and then stiching them together as an animation gif:

```python
class Animator():
    """ Creates an animation file of specified target size. """
    
    def __init__(self, file: Path, fps: int, loop=1) -> None:
        """ Create an Animator. Suggest the file should be a .gif.
        Set frames per second (fps). 
        Set loop to 0, to loop indefinitely. Default is 1. """
        self._outputfile = file
        self._frames = []  # can be in-memory BytesIO objects, or files
        self._fps = fps
        self._loop = loop
        
        dir_path = Path(self._outputfile).parent
        if not Path.exists(dir_path):
            Path.mkdir(dir_path)
    
    def save_anim(self):
        """ Takes animation frames, and converts to a single animated file. """
        logger.debug("Saving animation...")
        with imageio.get_writer(self._outputfile, mode='I', fps=self._fps, loop=self._loop) as writer:
            for frame in tqdm(self._frames):
                image = imageio.imread(frame)
                writer.append_data(image)
                
        logger.info("Animation saved to %s", self._outputfile)
    
    def add_frame(self, frame):
        """ Add a frame to the animation.
        The frame can be in the form of a BytesIO object, or a file Path
        """
        self._frames.append(frame)
```

Some things to note about this class:

- The `__init__()` is passed an output file, as well as the desired _frames per second_ in the animation.
  - This method takes care of creating the output folder, if it doesn't yet exist.
- The `add_frame()` method is called by our Grid's `_render_frame()` method. We can pass in a path to an actual file, or we can pass an BytesIO object.
- The `save_anim()` method converts our set of frames to a single animation gif file.
  - It does this by using **imageio** to read each file / BytesIO object, and then appending it to the `writer` context manager.
  - As I've done with several AoC challenges this year, I've wrapped the `for` loop that creates the animation with `tqdm`, in order to generate a progress bar. That's because generating the animation with 360 cycles (and thus 721 frames) takes 20 seconds or so.  So I wanted some sort of visual feedback.

And here's what these animations look like:

Well, that was a touch AoC.  Tougher than any I've done before.

I hope you found these walkthroughs useful. I've really enjoyed creating them.
