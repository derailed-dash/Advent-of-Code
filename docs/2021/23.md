## Solution Intro

Yep, this one was hard too.  Not as hard as yesterday though.  It was much easier to see how to do the solution. Essentially, you have two options:

1. With a **Dijkstra breadth first search (BFS)**.
1. With **recursion**.

I've opted for Dijkstra, and I'll describe the solution here.
