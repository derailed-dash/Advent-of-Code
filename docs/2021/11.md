## Solution Intro

We're told we're in a cavern full of bioluminescent octopi, arranged neatly in a 10x10 grid. Each octopus has an energy level form 0-9.  In each cycle:

- Each octopus gains +1 energy.
- Any octopus with energy >9 flashes.
  - Any octopi adjacent to the flashing octopus will gain additional +1.
  - Which may in turn cause other octopi to flash.
  - Repeat the flash cascade until no more flashing.
- Reset any flashed octopi back to energy level of 0.

The input data looks like this:

```
5483143223
2745854711
5264556173
6141336146

```

## Solution #1

Today's challenge is quite simple and easy enough to understand. To make it a bit more interesting, I've added some code to animate our octopi.

### Setup

```python
from copy import deepcopy
from dataclasses import dataclass
import logging
import os
import time
from PIL import Image, ImageFont, ImageDraw

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__) 
INPUT_FILE = "input/input.txt"
# INPUT_FILE = "input/sample_input.txt"

RENDER_ANIMATION = False
OUTPUT_DIR = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, "output/")
ANIM_FILE = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, "octopi.gif")  # where we'll save the animation to

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:\t%(message)s", 
                    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

We've used most of this before.  We used the PIL (Pillow) package back in [Day 9](9). And `copy.deepcopy()` is a way of creating a _recursive_ nested copy of an object. This means that any changes to the copied object, or changes to any of the nested objects _within_ that object, will not affect the object we originally copied from.

### Part 1

We're asked to **count the cumulative number of flashes, after 100 cycles.**

### Solving the Problem

Let's start with a `Point` class, i.e. to store the location of each octopus, and to yield any neighbours of a given octopus.  (Since we need the flash to impart energy to neighbours.) We've used similar `Point` classes before.  Note that this Point class yields diagonal neighbours, as well as orthogonal neighbours.  I.e. each octopus will have 8 neighbours (for octopi not at an edge).

Once again, we'll use a frozen (immutable) dataclass.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    """ Our immutable point data class """
    ADJACENT_DELTAS = [(dx,dy) for dx in range(-1, 2) 
                               for dy in range(-1, 2) if (dx,dy) != (0,0)]
    
    x: int
    y: int
    
    def yield_neighbours(self):
        """ Yield adjacent (orthogonal) neighbour points """
        for vector in Point.ADJACENT_DELTAS:
            yield Point(self.x + vector[0], self.y + vector[1])
```

Now let's add a Grid class:

```python
class Grid():
    """ 2D grid of point values. Knows how to:
       - Determine value at any point
       - Determine all neighbouring points of a given point
       - Perform an 'energy cycle' """
       
    FLASH_THRESHOLD = 9
    ENERGY_RESET = 0
       
    def __init__(self, grid_array: list) -> None:
        """ Generate Grid instance from 2D array. 
        This works on a deep copy of the input data, so as not to mutate the input. """
        
        self._array = deepcopy(grid_array)  # Store a deep copy of input data
        self._x_size = len(self._array[0])
        self._y_size = len(self._array)
        self._generation = 0
        self._cumulative_flashes = 0
    
    @property
    def x_size(self):
        """ Array width (cols) """
        return self._x_size
    
    @property
    def y_size(self):
        """ Array height (rows) """
        return self._y_size
    
    @property 
    def cumulative_flashes(self) -> int:
        """ Total flashes in the life of this grid """
        return self._cumulative_flashes
    
    @property
    def generation(self) -> int:
        """ Return the current generation cycle of this grid """
        return self._generation
    
    def set_value_at_point(self, point: Point, value: int):
        self._array[point.y][point.x] = value
        
    def value_at_point(self, point: Point) -> int:
        """ Value at this point """
        return self._array[point.y][point.x]
    
    def _valid_location(self, point: Point) -> bool:
        """ Check if a location is within the grid """
        if (0 <= point.x < self.x_size and  0 <= point.y < self.y_size):
            return True
        
        return False
    
    def all_points(self) -> list[Point]:
        points = [Point(x, y) for x in range(self.x_size) for y in range(self.y_size)]
        return points
              
    def cycle(self) -> int:
        """ Perform a grid cycle:
          - Octopus flashes when its energy is GREATER than 9.
          - When it flashes, it increments the energy of all adjacent octopi.

          - Once flashing is complete, any octopi that have flashed are reset to 0.
        
        Returns [int]: flashes in this cycle """

        # Step 1: increment all by 1     
        for point in self.all_points():
            self.set_value_at_point(point, self.value_at_point(point)+1)
        
        # Step 2: flash cascade
        flashed_octopi = set()     # Track which octopi have already flashed
        still_flashing = True
        while still_flashing:     # repeat this loop until no more flashing
            still_flashing = False
            for point in self.all_points():
                if point not in flashed_octopi and self.value_at_point(point) > Grid.FLASH_THRESHOLD:
                    flashed_octopi.add(point) # This octopus now flashes
                    still_flashing = True
                    for neighbour in point.yield_neighbours():  # increment any unflashed neighbours
                        if self._valid_location(neighbour):
                            if neighbour not in flashed_octopi:
                                self.set_value_at_point(neighbour, self.value_at_point(neighbour)+1)
            
        # Step 3: reset all flashed octopi back to 0
        for point in flashed_octopi:
            self.set_value_at_point(point, Grid.ENERGY_RESET)
            
        self._cumulative_flashes += len(flashed_octopi)    # update grid cumulative flash count
        self._generation += 1
               
        return len(flashed_octopi)
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "\n".join("".join(map(str, row)) for row in self._array)
```

Some notes about this class:

- We're defining two constants at class level, i.e. `FLASH_THRESHOLD` and `ENERGY_RESET`. Thus, there is only ever one copy of these constants, rather than a copy per instance of the class.
- The `__init__()` method takes the grid array we read from the input data, and makes a deep copy of it.  This is so that we can create more than one instance of a Grid object, without worrying about messing up one instance by cycling the other instance.
- We define some _properties_, for exposing internal data of a Grid object, such as its width (`s_size`), its height (`y_size`), `cumulative_flashes`, and the current cycle `generation`. 
- Note that we also use the Python convention of prefixing instance variables with `_`, to indicate that they should not be accessed directly from outside of the class.  Where we do need to access an instance variable, we've provided a `property`.
- The `all_points()` method uses `list comprehension` to a return a `list` of `Point` objects, for each location in the grid.
- We override the `__repr__()` method, to provide a means to unambiguously represent an instance of the object. If we don't also override `__str__()`, then Python will fallback on `__repr__()` when pringint an object.  So, **always override** `__repr__()`.

All the clever stuff happens in the `cycle()` method, which:

- Increments the energy level of all octopi in the grid by 1.
- Stores a set of any octopi that have flashed this cycle.
- While any octopi have flashed this cycle:
  - Iterate through all the octopi and:
    - If any have reached the energy threshold:
      - Add them to the set.
      - Get its neighbours, and increment their energy.
- Finally
  - For all octopi in the flashed set, reset their energy to 0.
  - Increment the cumulative number of flashes by the number of octopi in the set.
  - Increment the generation (cycle) counter.

Now we just need to evolve our Grid through 100 cycles:

```python
input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
    data = [[int(posn) for posn in row] for row in f.read().splitlines()]
    
# Part 1 - How many flashes after 100 steps?
grid = Grid(data)
for _ in range(100):
    grid.cycle()

logger.info("Part 1: total flashes=%d", grid.cumulative_flashes)
```

Easy.

### Part 2

We're told that eventually the **flashing cascades will cause all the octopi to synchronise, such that they all flash at the same time.  How many cycles will this take?**

Clearly, the octopi are synchronised when they've all flashed at the same time. So, let's just test whether the number of octopi that have flashed is equal to the total number of octopi:

```python
# Part 2
while True:
    flash_count = grid.cycle()
    if flash_count == grid.x_size * grid.y_size:    # all octopi have flashed
        break

logger.info("Part 2: synchronised at step: %d", grid.generation)  
```

So, we just continue cycling our grid, until the condition is met. Note that we don't need to create a new `Grid` or start cycling from the beginning again.  We can just carry on where we left off, after Part 1. 

And the output:

```
2022-01-19 19:45:22.533:INFO:__main__:  Part 1: total flashes=1741
2022-01-19 19:45:23.047:INFO:__main__:  Part 2: synchronised at step: 440
2022-01-19 19:45:23.073:INFO:__main__:  Execution time: 0.2432 seconds
```

## Visualisation

Finally, let's add an animation.

First, let's store our animation frames in the object:

```python
    def __init__(self, grid_array: list, render_animation=False) -> None:
        """ Generate Grid instance from 2D array. 
        This works on a deep copy of the input data, so as not to mutate the input. """
        
        self._array = deepcopy(grid_array)  # Store a deep copy of input data
        self._x_size = len(self._array[0])
        self._y_size = len(self._array)
        self._generation = 0
        self._cumulative_flashes = 0
        
        self._render_animation = render_animation
        self._frames: list[Image.Image] = [] # for animating
```

Note that `__init__()` method contains an optional argument which defines if we actually want to render the animation.  We want this because rendering the animation takes a few seconds.  So we may want to turn this off.

Next, let's add a method to generate a frame with each cycle:

```python
    def generate_frame(self):
        """ Render an image frame showing the current cycle state.
        Saves the frame to the self._frames list.
        Superimposes the cycle number text to the frame. """
        scale = 25
        all_values = [self.value_at_point(point) for point in self.all_points()] # flattened values
        max_energy = Grid.FLASH_THRESHOLD
        
        # create a new list of pixels, where each is given by an (R,G,B) tuple.
        pixel_colour_map = list(map(lambda x: (x*255//max_energy, 0, 0), all_values)) 
        
        # Create an image from the flattened list of pixels, and scale up the size
        small_image = Image.new(mode='RGB', size=(self.x_size, self.y_size))
        small_image.putdata(pixel_colour_map)  # load our original data into the image
        scaled_image = small_image.resize((self.x_size * scale, self.y_size * scale))

        # Add our cycle count text to the bottom right of the image
        image_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(scaled_image)        
        font = ImageFont.truetype('arial.ttf', 24)
        text = str(self._generation)
        rgba = (140, 200, 250, 255) # light blue
        textwidth, textheight = image_draw.textsize(text, font)
        im_width, im_height = scaled_image.size
        margin = 10     # margin we want round the text to the edge
        x_locn = im_width - textwidth - margin
        y_locn = im_height - textheight - margin
        image_draw.text((x_locn, y_locn), text, font=font, fill=rgba)
        
        if (0, 0, 0) in pixel_colour_map:  # if 0 in colour_map, we need to flash  
            flash_image = small_image.copy()
            new_image_data = []
            for pixel in pixel_colour_map:
                if pixel == (0, 0, 0):  # replace black with white
                    new_image_data.append((255, 255, 255))
                else:
                    new_image_data.append(pixel)
            
            # Add the new image data, and then resize as before
            flash_image.putdata(new_image_data)
            flash_image = flash_image.resize((self.x_size * scale, self.y_size * scale))
            
            flash_image_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(flash_image)
            flash_image_draw.text((x_locn, y_locn), text, font=font, fill=rgba)
            
            # Flash frame needs to get appended before the 'black' frame
            self._frames.append(flash_image)

        self._frames.append(scaled_image)
```

This method does the following:

- Gets all the octopus energy levels and flattening into a single `list`.
- Converts each energy level into an RGB colour value (as a `tuple`). Only the red component varies with the energy level.
- We then create an `Image`, with dimensions that match the grid.  I.e. a tiny 10x10 pixel image.
- Loads the list of RGB tuples into the image.
- Resizes the image using a scale factor.
- Then we use `ImageDraw.Draw(scaled_image)` to add a frame count to the bottom right corner.
- We now look for any RGB values that are `(0,0,0)`. These occur where the octopus energy was 0, i.e. where an octopus has just flashed.  
  - For these, we want to add in a flash frame. 
  - We do this by making a copy of the small image, and wherever the pixel value is `(0,0,0)`, we add an all-white `(255,255,255)` pixel, to represent the flash.
  - Of course, we need to resize this tiny frame, like we did with the previous frame.
- Finally, we add the frame to our `_frames` instance variable.

Then we add a call to `generate_frame()` in the `cycle()` method.

Finally, we want a method that actually saves _all_ the frames to a file, such as an animated. gif.

```python
    def save_frames(self, file: str, duration=50) -> None:
        """ Save the animation frames to the specified file.

        Args:
            file (str): File path to save to
            duration (int, optional): Frame length in ms. Defaults to 50.
            scale (int, optional): Size of each pixel. Defaults to 20.
        """
        if not self._frames:
            logger.info("Nothing to save")
            return
        
        dir_path = os.path.dirname(file)
        if not os.path.exists(dir_path):
            os.makedirs(dir_path)
        
        try:
            self._frames[0].save(file, save_all=True, loop=True, blend=1, duration=duration, append_images=self._frames[1:])
            logger.info("Animation saved to %s", file)
        except (KeyError, IOError):
            logger.error("Unable to save to %s", file)
```

As with previous visualisations, this method first checks if the target parent directy exists, and creates it if it doesn't. Then we call the `save()` method on the first frame, adding in all the remaining frames as a parameter, and specifying the frame length in ms.

Finally, let's actually create and save the animation:

```python
# let's add a few more cycles, to demonstrate the synchronisation
for _ in range(60):
    flash_count = grid.cycle()

grid.save_frames(ANIM_FILE, duration=100) # save to file
```

The rendered animation looks something like this:
