## Solution Intro

Here I've documented two different solutions to this problem:

- [Solution #1](#solution-1) - With cost functions
- [Solution #2](#solution-2) - Optimising with SciPy

Phew, a nice easy one today.

We're told that a giant whale is attacking our sub. A swarm of crabs, each in their own tiny sub, has come to rescue us. They're going to blast a hole in the ocean floor that we can escape through. In order to blast, all the crabs need to align in a single vertical column. They are currently at various horizontal positions, so we need all the crabs to move to a single horizontal position, in order to form the vertical column.

The crab subs can only move horizontally, and moving costs fuel.  We need to align them to a single column, with the lowest cost.

Our input data is the horizontal positions of all the crabs:

```
16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14
```

## Part 1

Given the current crab positions, and with each 1 unit horizontal move by a crab costing 1 fuel, **move all the crabs to the horizontal position that costs the least fuel. What is the total fuel cost?**

## Solution #1

We start by reading the input data, splitting the data at the commas, and converting each input value to an `int`. (Nothing new here.)

```python
input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
    data = [int(x) for x in f.read().split(",")]
    
logger.info("Part 1 min cost: %s", get_min_cost(data))
```

Then we pass our `list` of `int` values into our `get_min_cost()` function.

```python
def get_min_cost(data, cost_func=lambda x: x) -> tuple:
    """ Function that determines the minimum total cost to arrange our crabs

    Args:
        data (array): The initial crab positions
        cost_func (func, optional): Determines the cost for a given distance.
                                    Defaults to a cost of 1 per unit distance.

    Returns:
        tuple: Alignment position, cost
    """
    max_horizontal = max(data)
    
    costs = {}
    for i in range(max_horizontal+1):
        individual_costs = []
        for posn in data:
            individual_costs.append(cost_func(abs(posn - i)))
        
        costs[i] = sum(individual_costs)    # sun of all the costs to reach this position

    min_cost = min(costs.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return min_cost   
```

This function starts by determining the first crab that is furthest out. Clearly, there will be no point forming a column further out than this. Then we iterate through all possible horizontal positions between 0 and furthest out, and for each horizontal position, we determine the cost to get there, for each crab. We add up all the crab costs, and store that against `cost[i]`, where `i` is the horizontal position.

Finally, we return a `tuple` of the position `[i]` that has the lowest cost of all the positions, `cost[i]`.

And that's all there is to Part 1!

Note the use of this lambda function as a parameter:

```python
cost_func=lambda x: x
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
def some_anonymous_function(x):
    return x
```

So, this function simply takes an input distance - i.e. the distance between where the crab is now, and where it needs to get to - and then returns that same value as the cost.

You may be asking: "If we're just returning the number we pass in, then what's the point?" That brings us to Part 2...

## Part 2

Now we're told that the **cost per unit of horizontal crab movement increases with distance.** So, moving 1 unit costs 1, moving a second unit costs 2, moving a third unit costs 3.

Thus:

<table class="dazbo-table" style="width: 440px">
    <tr>
      <th style="width:100px">Step</th>
      <th style="width:100px">Step Cost</th>
      <th>Cumulative Cost</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr>
</table>

So the cumulative costs are the `triangle numbers`!

All we need to do is update this line to use a new cost function, i.e. one that returns the triangle number, rather than simply itself.

```python
logger.info("Part 1 min cost: %s", get_min_cost(data))
```

The simplest way to do it would be to simply do a `sum` of the `range` of the number of steps taken.  I.e. if a crab moves 3 places, we would do a sum of `1, 2, 3`. This works, but it's a little slow, since we have to compute all the step values and add them up.

It's much easier to use a bit of basic math. Specifically, the formula that returns the [sum of an arithmetic sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/sequences-sums-arithmetic.html){:target="_blank"}. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between one term and the next is constant. The sum of first n terms in an arithmetic series is given by:

$$S_{n} = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)$$

where `S`<sub>`n`</sub> gives us the sub for `n` terms, `a` is the value of the first term, and `d` is the difference between the terms.

For our problem, the cost for the first move is always 1, so `a=1`.  And the increment in cost with each step is 1, so `d=1`. Thus, the equation simplifies to:

$$S_{n} = \frac{n}{2}(n+1)$$

How do we update our function call to do this? Easy... just pass in the new lambda function as a parameter to the function.

```python
logger.info("Part 2 min cost: %s", get_min_cost(data, lambda n: n*(n+1)/2)) 
```

And the output looks like this:

```
2022-01-12 13:57:56.124:INFO:__main__:  Part 1 min cost: (350, 345035)
2022-01-12 13:57:56.461:INFO:__main__:  Part 2 min cost: (478, 97038163)
2022-01-12 13:57:56.461:INFO:__main__:  Execution time: 0.5585 seconds
```

Not too bad.

We could optimise a bit by only caring about unique starting positions.  (Much like the lanternfish solution.) But it probably wouldn't make much difference. 

## Solution #2

Here we're going to use both [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html){:target="_blank"} and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/general.html){:target="_blank"}. This makes for much shorter code!

The advantage of using NumPy is that we can read the input csv data, and convert it into an `np array` all in one line. Furthermore, in our cost function, we can pass in any given position, and then use the numpy `sum` function to return the aggregate distance of that position from all elements in the array, all in one line.

Finally, we use the `optimize.minimize_scalar()` function from SciPy, in order to quickly determine which input value produces the minimum result, given a cost function.  This saves us trawling through all positions, and then evaluating which position had the smallest cost.

```python
import logging
import os
import time
import numpy as np
from scipy import optimize

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__) 
INPUT_FILE = "input/input.txt"
# INPUT_FILE = "input/sample_input.txt"

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d:%(levelname)s:%(name)s:\t%(message)s", 
                    datefmt='%H:%M:%S')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)

input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
data: np.ndarray = np.loadtxt(input_file, delimiter=",", dtype=np.int32)

# minimize_scaler expects the function as first param, and args are any additional params the func requires
cost_part_1 = optimize.minimize_scalar(cost, args=(data))
logger.info("Part 1 min cost: %s", round(cost_part_1.fun))

cost_part_2 = optimize.minimize_scalar(cost, args=(data, lambda n: n*(n+1)/2))
logger.info("Part 2 min cost: %s", round(cost_part_2.fun)) 

def cost(posn: int, data: np.ndarray, cost_func=lambda n: n) -> int:
    """ Return the sum of applying the cost_func to get to position n, for every item in the array. """
    return cost_func(np.abs(posn-data)).sum()
```

Output:

```
2022-01-12 19:48:56.137:INFO:__main__:  Part 1 min cost: 345035
2022-01-12 19:48:56.137:INFO:__main__:  Part 2 min cost: 97038064
2022-01-12 19:48:56.137:INFO:__main__:  Execution time: 0.0033 seconds
```

Same answer, but over 100x faster!
