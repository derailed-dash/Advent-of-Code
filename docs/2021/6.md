## Solution Intro

Here I've documented three different approaches to this problem:

- [Solution #1](#solution-1) - The naive way
- [Solution #2](#solution-2) - The NumPy way
- [Solution #3](#solution-3) - Using `deque.rotate()`

We're told that lanternfish populations grow exponentially, and we're asked to model the growth of the population. Each lanternfish spawns a new lanternfish every 7 days, except for new lanternfish, which require an extra 2 days before spawning a new fish.

Our input data is a list of numbers, which are the number of days left until each fish spawns another fish.  The data looks like this:

```
3,4,3,1,2
```

## Part 1

Given our input data, **how many lanternfish will there be after 80 days?**

## Solution #1

At first glance, this seems like a simple problem. The naive approach is short and easy to write.  Alas, as we'll see, it has a problem!

We create list of `fish_timers` from the input data, where each timer is the number of days until the next spawn. With each day, we update the existing fish timers, and add the new timers.

```python
input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
    data = f.read()
    
fish_timers = list(map(int, data.split(",")))
logger.debug(fish_timers)   # E.g. [3,4,3,1,2]

fish_timers_copy = fish_timers.copy()
days = 80
for _ in range(1, days+1):
    # we can't enumerate since we don't extra iterations when we spawn
    for i in range(len(fish_timers_copy)):
        if fish_timers_copy[i] == 0:
            fish_timers_copy[i] = 6     # reset this fish timer
            fish_timers_copy.append(8)  # spawn a new fish
        else:
            fish_timers_copy[i] -= 1    # decrement this fish timer

logger.info("After %d days, there are %d fish", days, len(fish_timers_copy))   
```

The code above reads in the input data, splits it at the commas, and then converts each value to an `int`. Nothing new there.

First, we make a copy of the `fish_timers`. This is just so that we can use the same original input list when we do part 2.

Then we iterate through 80 days. Note that in this `for` loop, we store each day in the variable `_`. This is a convention in Python: if we're not interested in this variable, and we're not going to use it, then we use the value `_`.

Then, for each day, we now iterate through each `fish_timer` (i.e. each fish), and do the following:

- If the fish timer is at 0, the fish must spawn a new fish.  
  - Add a new timer with a value of 8. (Since all new fish require 9 days before spawning a new fish. Timers are 0-indexed.)
  - Change this fish timer to 6, i.e. since this fish is now 7 days away from its next spawn.
- For all other timers, decrement their value by 1.

And for Part 1, this approach works fine!

```
2022-01-09 22:11:00.555:INFO:__main__:  After 80 days, there are 376194 fish
```

## Part 2.

Now we're simply asked to determine how many fish there will be after **256** days.

This presents us with a predictable problem.  Our naive solution doesn't scale!

<table class="dazbo-table" style="width: 340px">
    <tr>
      <th>Number of days</th>
      <th>Time to solve</th></tr>
    <tr><td>80s</td><td>0.5s</td></tr>
    <tr><td>90s</td><td>1.1s</td></tr>
    <tr><td>100s</td><td>3.1s</td></tr>
    <tr><td>110s</td><td>6.7s</td></tr>
    <tr><td>120s</td><td>17s</td></tr>
</table>

If we extrapolate, this is going to take days to run!  We need a different approach.

## Solution #2

At this point, it's obvious we can't model _every_ fish. We actually only need to track how many there of each timer, e.g. how many fish are spawning now, how many are 1 day away, how many are 2 days away, etc.

### Solving the Problem

Here we can read the source data directly into a numpy array, using `np.loadtxt`. We split the numbers at the commas, and convert each number to an int using `dtype=np.int8`.

```python
input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)

# read input, which is csv of ints
# Each value is a fish timer, i.e. days until spawning another fish  
data = np.loadtxt(input_file, delimiter=",", dtype=np.int8) # [3 4 3 1 2]
```

Then we use `np.unique()` with the `return_counts=True` attribute to return all the unique fish timers in the input data, and count them all.

```python
# np.unique() returns ordered unique items.  With return_counts=True, it includes counts.
# Timers [1 2 3 4], counts [1 1 2 1]
init_fish_timers, counts = np.unique(data, return_counts=True)
```

We know there will be timers for all values 0-8 inclusive. Our input data may not include all of these types of timers. So let's create a one dimensional numpy array of size 9 (i.e. 0-8 inclusive), and initialise all the values to 0.  This represents our counters for each fish timer.

Then we can update this 'zero' array using the `counts` we previously obtained from the input data. This works by using the `init_fish_timers` to find all the corresponding index positions in `fish_timers`, and then updating value at that position by using the corresponding position in the `counts` array. 

```python
# Initialise fish timers, by setting index positions to the counts in the array  
fish_timers = np.zeros(9, dtype=np.uint64)     # [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
fish_timers[init_fish_timers] = counts         # [0 1 1 2 1 0 0 0 0]
```

Now we create a `get_fish_count()` function, which returns the number of fish after the required number of days. It works by:

- Looping through the required number of days.
- Calling `np.roll(fish, -1)`, which effectively shifts the entire array one to the left, and wraps items on the far left over to the right.  Thus, timers that were 0 now become 8 (representing new fish), items that were 1 become 0, etc.
- We increment the number of timers at `[6]` by the number of fish that are now at `[8]`. I.e. the number of fish that have reset is equal to the number of fish that were just spawned.

```python
def get_fish_count(fish_timers: np.ndarray, day_num: int) -> int:
    fish = np.copy(fish_timers)    # create a new copy so we don't mutate the original fish
    for _ in range(day_num):
        fish = np.roll(fish, -1)  # Roll: 2 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 8 (spawned fish)  
        fish[6] += fish[8]    # Add fish that were 0 are now reset to 6.
    
    return sum(fish)
```

We can now call this function with both 80 and 256, thus solving both Part 1 and Part 2:

```python
for day in (80, 256):
    logger.info("At day %d, count=%d", day, get_fish_count(fish_timers, day))
```

The output looks like this:

```
2022-01-09 22:58:19.820:INFO:__main__:  At day 80, count=376194
2022-01-09 22:58:19.830:INFO:__main__:  At day 256, count=1693022481538
2022-01-09 22:58:19.831:INFO:__main__:  Execution time: 0.0353 seconds
```

It's quite quick!

## Solution #3

This solution is _super fast!_

We don't need numpy.  We can achieve the same results using a `Counter` and a `deque`.

First, read the data, split it at the commas, convert each value to `int`, and then store the counts of each type of fish timer:

```python
input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
    data = f.read()

data = [int(x) for x in data.split(",")]
fish_timer_counts = Counter(data) # count the timers for each fish
```

Now we create a `deque` that contains our nine timer values, 0-8 inclusive. The values are initialised to 0 if there weren't any in the input data.  Else, we use the counts from the input data.

```python
# initialise an array of timer counts, for all timer values 0-8    
timers = deque()
for timer in range(9):
    timers.append(fish_timer_counts[timer] if fish_timer_counts[timer] else 0)
```

As before, we have a `get_fish_count()` function. It does the following:

- Iterates through the required number of days.
- Rotates the entire deque to the left, i.e. so that 2 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 8, etc.
- Increments the count of [6] by the number of fish at [8], i.e. the count of fish that just reset.

```python
for days in (80, 256):
    logger.info("Fish at day %d: %d", days, get_fish_count(timers, days))

def get_fish_count(timers: deque, days: int):
    fish = timers.copy()    # just so we can repeat this method with a different # of days
    
    for _ in range(days):
        fish.rotate(-1)
        fish[6] += fish[8]  # count of newly spawned fish is same as count of fish that need to be reset
        
    return sum(fish)    
```

Output:

```
2022-01-09 22:59:06.606:INFO:__main__:  Fish at day 80: 376194
2022-01-09 22:59:06.607:INFO:__main__:  Fish at day 256: 1693022481538
2022-01-09 22:59:06.608:INFO:__main__:  Execution time: 0.0027 seconds
```

Yep, under 3ms.  Pretty quick!
