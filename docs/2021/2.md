## Solution Intro

We need to work out how to pilot the submarine! The input is a set of instructions that look like this:

```
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
```

### Part 1

We need to determine the horizontal position and depth after following the instructions, 
and then return the product of these two numbers.

```python
```

### Solving the Problem

The input data looks something like this:

```
199
200
208
210
200
```

This is a simple problem.  We want to look at each number, and see if it's bigger than the previous number.

### Part 2

Now the challenge is a tiny bit harder.  Rather than comparing each number to the last,
we now need to compare a sliding window of 3 numbers to the previous 3 numbers.

```python
```

## Solution #2

Here I'm using Numpy, a data science package that is awesome for manipulating arrays of data.
It makes for much shorter code in a problem like this.

### Setup

If you don't have Numpy installed, the easiest way to install it is with pip:

```
py -m pip install numpy
```
The rest of the setup is the same as before.

### Solving the Problem

```python
```

And that's it!
