## Problem Intro

We're given a list of people who will sit around a round table. We're asked to find the optimum seating arrangement, based on _total happiness_. Each person will be sat between two other people. People gain or lose happiness points, depending on who they are sat next to.

The input looks like this:

```text
Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
Alice would lose 79 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Alice would lose 2 happiness units by sitting next to David.
Bob would gain 83 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
Bob would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Bob would lose 63 happiness units by sitting next to David.
Carol would lose 62 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
Carol would gain 60 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
Carol would gain 55 happiness units by sitting next to David.
David would gain 46 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
David would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
David would gain 41 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
```

## Part 1

**What is the total change in happiness for the optimal seating arrangement of the actual guest list?**

The real input data doesn't have that many people.  There's only 8 people.  And so, there are only `8! = 40320` different ways to order these 8 people.  In modern day computing, this is nothing!

We can treat the arrangement of people as an [weighted directed graph](/python/graph){:target="_blank"}, also known as a **weighted digraph**. I.e. 
- Each person is a node in the graph.
- The edges have magnitude, where the magnitude is the _happiness_ that person A gets by sitting next to person B.
- It is a directed graph, because the magnitude of the edge from A to B will be different from the magnitude of the edge from B to A. Or, to put it another way, A may like B, but B might hate A!

As with [similar undirected graph challenges](/2015/9){:target="_blank"}, we can use a solution something like...

- Use regex to extract the happiness scores in each direction.
- Build an adjacency list to store the happiness score for each adjacent pair.
- Determine all 40000-ish arrangements (permutations) of the 8 people.
- Calculate the sum of happiness for each arrangement.

First, let's look at the function that creates our adjacency list, to get the happiness score for any pair of people:

```python
def get_happiness_by_person(data) -> dict[str, dict[str, int]]:
    """ Here we build an adjacency list.  We will map each person to every other person.
    Since this is a directed graph, we'll use a defaultdict(dict).

    Args:
        data (list): A list of happiness statements

    Returns:
        dict: dict[person_x][person_y: happiness]
    """
    # Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
    happiness = defaultdict(dict)
    happiness_pattern = re.compile(r"^(\w+) would (\w+) (\d+) happiness units by sitting next to (\w+)")
    
    for line in data:
        person_1, gain_or_lose, value, person_2 = happiness_pattern.findall(line)[0]
        if gain_or_lose == "gain":
            value = int(value)
        else:
            value = -(int(value))
    
        happiness[person_1][person_2] = value

    return happiness
```

This code:

- Uses regex to extract the names and happiness values from each statement. Nothing new here.
- Determines with the person _gains_ or _loses_ happiness, and sets the value to positive or negative, accordingly.
- We then use a [defaultdict](/python/defaultdict) that sets the key to a _person A_, 
  and then sets the value to an empty (default) `dict`. For each _person B_, we set add a key of _person B_ and set the value to be the _happiness_ score.

Having built our adjacency list, we create `set` of all the people in our data:

```python
    # build up a dict of hapiness scores for each person
    happiness_by_person = get_happiness_by_person(data)

    # create a set of all the people
    people = set(happiness_by_person.keys())
```

Now we want to determine the first person.  Because everyone is sat in a circle, we can arbitrarily choose someone to be the _head of the table_. All our seating permutations will assume this starting position. By restricting the first person to always be the same person, we dramatically reduce the number of permutations we need to work through. That's because there's one fewer persons in our set of people to establish permutations for.

If we didnt' fix the first position, we would have to work through `8! = 40320` permutations.  But by fixing the position of person 1, there are now only 7 remaining people to calculate permuations for. And `7! = 5040`.

```python
    # we don't care where the first person sits, since it's a circle.  
    # So let's just make person_1 the 'head' of the table
    person_1 = people.pop()

    # get all permutations for remaining people around the table, as list of tuples
    # We expect n! perms
    perms = list(permutations(people))
```

Finally, we can determine the total happiness score for each of our permutations:

```python
    happiness_for_seating = {}
    for perm in perms:
        # this allows us to remove reverse permutations
        if perm <= perm[::-1]:
            perm = list(perm)  # convert perm from tuple to list, to make it mutable
            perm.insert(0, person_1) # such that we can insert the head of the table

            # now convert back to tuple to make it hashable. Otherwise we can't use it as dict key
            happiness_for_perm[tuple(perm)] = compute_happiness_for_perm(perm, happiness_by_person)
```

It works like this:

- We create a `dict` to map each permutation against a _total happiness score_.
- We iterate through each of our permutations.  Recall that with one fixed position and 7 remaining positions, we only have 5040 permutations to work through.
- We then add another efficiency: we skip _reverse_ permutations. 
  - E.g. if we had a sequence `ABCDEF`, then we would ignore a sequence `FEDCBA`. Because, for people sat around a table, these are the same.
  - How do we do this?  Easy! We check if our current permutation is less than the reverse permutation, using the `[::-1]` construct to return the reversed list. We only go with the permutation that is arbitrarily the smaller one.
- We now must add back in our _head of the table_ to our current permutation. Remember that this person was previously excluded, when the permutations were calculated. We do this by using the `insert()` method to insert this person at the front of the `list`.
- Then we compute the total happiness for this arrangement.  Here's the code that achieves this:

```python
def compute_happiness_for_seating(seating_arrangement, happiness_by_person):
    happiness = 0

    for i, current_person in enumerate(seating_arrangement):
        if i < len(seating_arrangement) - 1:
            current_next_person = seating_arrangement[i+1]
        else:
            current_next_person = seating_arrangement[0]

        happiness += happiness_by_person[current_person][current_next_person]
        happiness += happiness_by_person[current_next_person][current_person]

    return happiness
```

This works by iterating over each person in our list of people, determining who the next (adjacent) person is, and retrieving the happiness score (relative to the first person) from our adjacently dictionary. Note that if we've reached the last person in our list, the code then sets the next person to be the first person in the list.  This works, because they are sat in a circle.

Having now built up a dictionary that maps each permutation to a total score, we're finally able to determine the permutation with the highest score.

```python
    optimum_happiness_seating = max(happiness_for_seating.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
    print("Part 1")
    print(f"Optimum happiness = {happiness_for_seating[optimum_happiness_seating]} with seating: {optimum_happiness_seating}")
```

The use of `max()` is interesting.  Here's how it works:

- We pass in our `dict` of `perm:score` as the first parameter, and using the dict's `items()` method, which returns all the `dict` K:V pairs as a tuple.
- We then set the key for our `max()` function to be a [lambda function](/python/functions#lambda-functions) that simply returns the second value from each tuple, i.e. the happiness total.

This is how we tell `max()` to retrieve the largest value, based on the `dict` value, rather than based on the `dict` key.

And that's it!

## Part 2

Now we're told we need to insert ourselves in the seating arrangement.  We're told we're ambivalent about who we sit next to, and they're ambivalent about us. I.e. the happiness score will be 0 in both directions, for anyone we're sat next to.

**What is the total change in happiness for the optimal seating arrangement that actually includes yourself?**

To solve this:

- Add person 1 - the head of the table - back in to the `set` of `people`.
- Extend the adjacency dictionary, by adding me as a neighbour to each other person.
- Once again, remove person 1 as the head of the table.
- Add _me_ to the `set` of `people`.

And then we can simply repeat the same code as in Part 1.

After a bit of refactoring, the final solution looks like this:

Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/13

A list of people sat around the table.
Happiness scores depend on who sets next to whom. E.g.
    Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.

Solution:
    Use a defaultdict to store happiness scores each person.  E.g.
        happiness[Alice][Bob] = 54
    
    Use a set to store all people.
    Find all permutations of people around the table using itertools.permutations().
    Create a dict happiness_for_perms
    For each perm:
        We don't want to process reverse order of perms, so check using <= vs last element
        For each person around the table clockwise:
            Add up the happiness of the adjacent people
        Store happiness for this perm

Part 1:
    Find happiness of optimal seating arrangement

Part 2:
    Add myself, and assume that all happiness relationships are 0, wherever I go.
    
    Add myself to the dict for every other person in the set.
    Add me to the set.
    Repeat Part 1.
