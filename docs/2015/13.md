## Problem Intro

We're given a list of people who will sit around a round table. We're asked to find the optimum seating arrangement, based on _total happiness_. Each person will be sat between two other people. People gain or lose happiness points, depending on who they are sat next to.

The input looks like this:

```text
Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
Alice would lose 79 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Alice would lose 2 happiness units by sitting next to David.
Bob would gain 83 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
Bob would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Bob would lose 63 happiness units by sitting next to David.
Carol would lose 62 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
Carol would gain 60 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
Carol would gain 55 happiness units by sitting next to David.
David would gain 46 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
David would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
David would gain 41 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
```

## Part 1

**What is the total change in happiness for the optimal seating arrangement of the actual guest list?**

The real input data doesn't have that many people.  There's only 8 people.  And so, there are only `8! = 40320` different ways to order these 8 people.  In modern day computing, this is nothing!

Thus, my solution is:

- Build a map to determine the happiness score for each adjacent pair of people.
- Determine all 40000-ish arrangements of the 8 people.
- Calculate the sum of happiness for each arrangement.

First, let's create an adjacency dictionary, to get the happiness score for any pair of people:

```python
def get_happiness_by_person(data) -> dict:
    # Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
    happiness = defaultdict(dict)
    happiness_pattern = re.compile(r"^(\w+) would (\w+) (\d+) happiness units by sitting next to (\w+)")
    
    for line in data:
        person_1, gain_or_lose, value, person_2 = happiness_pattern.match(line).groups()
        if gain_or_lose == "gain":
            value = int(value)
        else:
            value = -(int(value))
    
        happiness[person_1][person_2] = value

    return happiness
```
