## Problem Intro

We're told that we have wires - identified by lowercase letters - which carry 16 bit signals. A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or a specific value. Wires can only take a single input signal, but can provide a signal to multiple destinations. The gates are:

|Gate|Meaning|
|----|-------|
|`x AND y`|Bitwise AND of x and wy|
|`x OR y` |Bitwise OR of x and y|
|`x LSHIFT y`|Left-shift x by y positions|
|`x RSHIFT y`|Right-shift x by y positions|
|`NOT x`|Bitwise complement of x|

Gates will only provide an ouput signal when all of its inputs have a signal.

Instructions look like this:

```text
123 -> x
456 -> y
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
x LSHIFT 2 -> f
y RSHIFT 2 -> g
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i
```

I've solved this challenge in two separate ways:
