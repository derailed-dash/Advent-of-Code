## Problem Intro

We're told that we have wires - identified by lowercase letters - which carry 16 bit signals. A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or a specific value. Wires can only take a single input signal, but can provide a signal to multiple destinations. The gates are:

|Gate|Meaning|
|----|-------|
|`x AND y`|Bitwise AND of x and wy|
|`x OR y` |Bitwise OR of x and y|
|`x LSHIFT y`|Left-shift x by y positions|
|`x RSHIFT y`|Right-shift x by y positions|
|`NOT x`|Bitwise complement of x|

Gates will only provide an ouput signal when all of its inputs have a signal.

Instructions look like this:

```text
123 -> x
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
456 -> y
x LSHIFT 2 -> f
y RSHIFT 2 -> g
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i
```

## Part 1

**What signal is ultimately provided to wire a?**

What we need to do is process each instruction in the input.

The challenge is that some instructions can be processed straight away, but some cannot.  Specifically: if an instruction refers to any wires that do not yet have a value, then that instruction can not be processed yet.  To explain this further, look at the example instructions above.  We can process this instruction straight away:

```text
123 -> x
```

But we can't yet process these instruction, because we don't yet have a value for `y`:

```text
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
```

But the next instruction sets our value for `y`:

```text
456 -> y
```

So if we process the instructions for a second time, we will be able to process those two instructions that were previously blocked.

Thus, **my strategy is**:

1. Process the instructions from top to bottom. For each instruction:
  - If we are able to process the instruction (because all required inputs have values), then process the instruction, and then _pop it_ (remove it) from the instruction list. This instruction is done.
  - If we are unable to process the instruction (because we don't have all required input values), then we don't pop it yet.
1. For as long as we have instructions left, go back to 1.

## Solution Code

We could now write some regex to parse each instruction, determine the instruction type, and take action accordingly.  But we've done some of that already, so I thought it would be more fun to use a cool library.

Here we're going to use [Parsimonious](https://github.com/erikrose/parsimonious){:target="_blank"}. This is a library that allows the depth-first parsing of grammars, i.e. the capability to recognise language terms, and follow rules depending on those terms. 

![DFS vs BFS]({{"/assets/images/dfs-vs-bfs.png" | relative_url }}) 

Think of it like regex on steroids, since it has the ability to recognise specific language terms, but also recurse into those terms.

First, let's install _Parsimonious_:

```bash
py -m pip install parsimonious
```

Now let's write a grammar, i.e. some language that describes the instructions we need to parse: 

```text
expr = input? (op input)? feeds wire
input = (number / wire) ws+
op = ("AND" / "OR" / "LSHIFT" / "RSHIFT" / "NOT") ws+
number = ~r"\d+"
feeds = "-> "
wire = ~r"[a-z]{1,2}"
ws = ~r"\s"
```

What does it mean? Well, check out the [Parsimonious Syntax Reference](https://github.com/erikrose/parsimonious#syntax-reference){:target="_blank"} to get an understanding of how this grammar is constructed. But let's break it down, line-by-line:

- Each line describes rules for validating the input.
- Within each line, individual terms are separated by a single white space character.
- The first line - called `expr` - will be used to parse the entirety of each instruction. This rule checks that we have zero or more `input` elements, followed by zero or more combinations of `op input`, followed by a mandatory `feeds`, followed by a mandatory `wire`.
- We define an `input` as either a `number` or a `wire`, followed by some whitespace.
- We define an `op` as one of `AND`, `OR`, `LSHIFT`, `RSHIFT`, and `NOT`, followed by some whitespace.
- We defined a `number` as one or more digits.  We use simple regex to achieve this, and escape the regex with `~r`.
- We define a literal constant called `feeds`, which is set to the value `-> `.
- We define a `wire` as one or two alphabetical characters. We use regex to achieve this.
- We define `ws` as some whitespace, using regex.  We've made a variable for this, since whitespace is used frequently throughout the grammar.

Hopefully it's now apparent how this set of rules can be used to validate and parse our input instructions.

Now we need to write the class that will actually parse the input lines, according to our grammar, and return the resulting output wire value. We do this by extending the `NodeVisitor` class, which is supplied by the _parsimonious_ package.

```python
class BitwiseLogicVisitor(NodeVisitor):
    """ PEG Parser for processing the Bitwise instructions """
    # override the parse method, to initialise instance variables and perform the bitwise logic
    def parse(self, *args):
        """
        Arguments
            args[0] - the str to be parsed. E.g. 'k AND m -> n'
            args[1] - a dict of known wire values 

        Returns:
            [dict] - output wire:value
            
        Raises:
            ParseError, VisitationError
        """
        
        self._wires_dict = args[1] # store our known wire values
        
        # These instance variables are updated after we parse the input line
        self._inputs = []             # store int input values, left of the '->'. E.g. [7102, 65023]
        self._op = ""                 # E.g. AND

        else:
            # Where there is no op. E.g. '19138 -> b'

        wire = node.text.strip()
        if (self._processing_input):
            # if we have an input wire, then try to extract its numeric value

        else:  # otherwise, this is an output wire

        return wire

    def generic_visit(self, node, visited_children):
        return visited_children or node
```

Here's how it works...

- The `parse()` method expects two arguments:
  1. The current instruction line to be parsed. E.g. `456 -> y`.
  1. A `dict` containing all the wires that have known signal values.
- The `parse()` method then:
  - Initialises some instance variables. This includes setting the private instance variable `_processing_input` to `True`. This signals that whenever we parse a `wire`, we should treat it as an `input`, rather than a target wire.
  - It then calls `super().parse()`, and passes in the current instruction line. This causes the `BitwiseLogicVisitor` to fire the appropriate `visit_xxxx()` method, for each string it matches from the grammar.  E.g. 
    - Any complete instruction should match `expr`, which results in `visit_expr()` being fired.
    - When the parser matches `feeds`, it fires the `visit_feeds()` method.

Let's look at what some of these `visit_xxxx` methods do:
  - `visit_feeds` sets the private variable `_processing_input` to `False`. As a result, the next wire that is parsed will be treated as the target wire, not an input wire.
  - `visit_op` stores the operation type.
  - `visit_number` converts the `str` repesentation of the number to an `int`, and stores it in the `_inputs` list.
  - `visit_wire`:
    - If `_processing_input` is `True`, this method attempts to obtain the signal value stored in this input wire.  If this wire currently has no value, then the dict lookup will cause a `KeyError`, which is thrown by the class as a `VisitationError`.
    - If `_processing_input` is `False`, then we set the `_target_wire` to be this particular wire str.
  
  - Finally - assuming we didn't exit parsing with a `VisitationError` - we return to the `parse()` method. We are now able to perform our logic gate operation, since we now have all required inputs. We can now perform the desired bitwise operation.  We then return our output value.

That's most of the hard work done.  Now all we need to do is implement the strategy; i.e. to process the full set of instructions, processing those that we can, and parking those that we can't until the next iteration.  Here's how we do that:

```python
def process_instructions(instructions, blc_visitor):
    wire_values = {}

    # treat all our input as a stack.  
    # Some input values will not be known yet, so park these instructions and try on the next iteration
    while instructions:
        for i, line in enumerate(instructions):
            try:
                wire_values.update(blc_visitor.parse(line, wire_values))
                # if we're here, the instruction parsed successfully, so remove it from the stack permanently
                popped = instructions.pop(i)
                logger.debug("Processed: %s", popped)
            except (ParseError, VisitationError):
                # If the parser tries to retrieve a wire value that is not yet known
                # a KeyError is thrown, caught, and rethrown as a VisitationError, which we catch here.
                # This instruction can't be processed yet, as we don't have all necessary input values
                continue

        # We're ready to process the list again. 
    
    return wire_values
```

This is a function that takes our instructions as the first parameter, and an instance of our `BitwiseLogicVisitor` as the second parameter.

We then iterate through the instructions, line-by-line, [enumerating](/python/enumerate){:target="_blank"} as we go. For each instruction:

- Attempt to parse using our `BitwiseLogicVisitor`.  Pass in all wire values that we've determined so far.
- If the parse succeeds, then:
  - The `parse()` method will return a value for a new wire. 
  - We add this wire:value pair to the existing `wire_values` dictionary.
  - We `pop()` the current instruction from the list of instructions. I.e. we're removing this instruction line so that it won't be processed again.
- If we're trying to perform an instruction using a wire that we don't know the value of, then this will cause a `KeyError` to be generated in the `visit_wire()` method of the `BitwiseLogicVisitor`. I.e. when we try to obtain the value of a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary. This is thrown as a `VisitationError`, which we catch.

Once we've processed all the instruction lines, we then start again with all remaining instructions.  We keep doing this until no instructions remain.

The final solution looks like this:

## Part 2

**We need to take the value of a that we've just determined, set b to that value, reset all the other wires and then repeat all the instructions. And, as before, determine what value is now emitted on wire a.**

This is pretty easy and doesn't require many extra lines:

```python
    # Part 2
    wire_b_instr = list(filter(re.compile(r"-> b$").search, data)) # return only rows that match
    assert len(wire_b_instr) == 1, "There should only be one matching instruction"
    wire_b_instr_index = data.index(wire_b_instr[0])  # the position of this instruction in the list
    data[wire_b_instr_index] = f"{a_val} -> b"  # replace the instruction with this new one

    results = process_instructions(data.copy(), blc_visitor)
    logger.info("Part 2: Value of input a is %s", results['a'])
```

No other changes to the program are required.
