## Solution Intro

We're told that Santa is delivering presents to an infinite 2D grid of houses.  We're given a set of instructions that tells Santa how to navigate. With each instruction, Santa moves exactly one unit either north (^), south (v), east (>) or west (<).

The instructions are all on a single line of data, that looks something like this:

```text
>^^v^<>v<<<v<v^>>v^^
```

I've solved today's puzzle using two nearly identical solutions:

- Using a **Point class** to represent Santa's location
- Using **Complex numbers** to represent Santa's location. It's nearly identical, but quite a bit quicker.

## Part 1

**How many houses receive at least one present?**

This is simple enough to solve. We just need to track every location we've visited.  At the end, we need to determine how many locations we visited.  We don't care about the order, and we don't care about how many times a location was visited.  Only whether it was visited or not.

Whenever you see a problem with these characteristics, then your brain should be screaming **[sets](/python/sets)** as the obvious way to go about it.
