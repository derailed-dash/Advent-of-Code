## Solution Intro

The elves need more wrapping paper.

We're given the dimensions (length, width, height) of a list of presents, where dimensions are given in feet. E.g.

```text
2x3x4
1x1x10
```

Every present is a _rectangular cuboid_, so we know the surface area is given by `2(lw + wh + lh)`. That's because the cuboid is composed of three pairs of opposite faces.  So we work out the area of each of three different faces, add them together, and then multiply by two.
