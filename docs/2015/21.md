## Problem Intro

We need win an RPG computer game match. 

We alternative taking turns with the CPU.  The CPU is playing the boss. The current player attacks on their turn.
- The attack reduces the opponent's hit points.
- The loser is player whose hit points reach 0 (or lower).
- Attack logic:
  - Damage taken = attacker's damage - defender's armor, with a minimum of 1.
- Damage and armor score start at 0 and can be increased by buying items
