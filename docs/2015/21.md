## Problem Intro

We need win an RPG computer game match. 

We alternative taking turns with the CPU.  The CPU is playing the boss. The current player attacks on their turn.
- The attack reduces the opponent's hit points.
- The loser is player whose hit points reach 0 (or lower).
- `Damage taken = attacker's damage - defender's armor`, with a minimum of 1.
- Damage and armor score start at 0 and can be increased by buying items from the shop, in exchange for gold. Gold is unlimited.

The shop's products are given to us:

```text
Weapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor
Dagger        8     4       0
Shortsword   10     5       0
Warhammer    25     6       0
Longsword    40     7       0
Greataxe     74     8       0

Armor:      Cost  Damage  Armor
Leather      13     0       1
Chainmail    31     0       2
Splintmail   53     0       3
Bandedmail   75     0       4
Platemail   102     0       5

Rings:      Cost  Damage  Armor
Damage +1    25     1       0
Damage +2    50     2       0
Damage +3   100     3       0
Defense +1   20     0       1
Defense +2   40     0       2
Defense +3   80     0       3
```

Shop rules:
- We must buy exactly one weapon.
- We can buy one armor item.
- We can buy 0, 1, or 2 rings.
- The shop only has one of each item.

**We start with 100 hit points. Our damage and armor scores are given by the sum of the respective values of the items we have bought. Our opponent's starting hit points, damage and armor scores are given to us as input.** E.g.

```text
Hit Points: 104
Damage: 8
Armor: 1
```

## Part 1

**What is the least amount of gold you can spend and still win the fight?**

Let's start with the easy part: reading in the shop information. I copied the shop text into a file, because I didn't know if the shop data might change for Part 2. 

First, I create a dataclass to store each row read from the file.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Item:
    """ Immutable class for the properties of shop items """
    name: str
    cost: int
    damage: int
    armor: int
```

Then, I read the shop data using [regex](/python/regex), as follows:

```python
def process_shop_items(data) -> tuple[dict, dict, dict]:
    """ Process shop items and return tuple of weapons, armor and rings.
    Each tuple member is a dict, mapping a shop item to its properties (name, cost, damage, armor).

    Args:
        data (List[str]): Lines from the shop file

    Returns:
        Tuple[dict, dict, dict]: Dictionaries of weapons, armor and rings. 
                                 Each dict is a mapping of item name to an Item object.
    """
    # e.g. "Damage +1    25     1       0"
    item_match = re.compile(r"^(.*)\s{2,}(\d+).+(\d+).+(\d+)")

    weapons = {}
    armor = {}
    rings = {}

    block = ""
    for line in data:
        if "Weapons:" in line:
            block = "weapons"
        elif "Armor:" in line:
            block = "armor"
        elif "Rings:" in line:
            block = "rings"
        else: # we're processing items listed in the current block type
            match = item_match.match(line)
            if match:
                item_name, cost, damage_score, armor_score = match.groups()
                item_name = item_name.strip()
                cost, damage_score, armor_score = int(cost), int(damage_score), int(armor_score)
                if block == "weapons":
                    weapons[item_name] = Item(item_name, cost, damage_score, armor_score)
                elif block == "armor":
                    armor[item_name] = Item(item_name, cost, damage_score, armor_score)
                elif block == "rings":
                    rings[item_name] = Item(item_name, cost, damage_score, armor_score)

    return weapons, armor, rings
```

The regex works as follows:

- `^` denotes the start of the line.
- `(.*)` captures any sequence of characters. The `.*` means "any character (.) repeated zero or more times (*)". The parentheses are used to create a capturing group, which allows this sequence of characters to be extracted later. This is how we capture the name of the item.
- `\s{2,}` matches two or more whitespace characters. `\s` represents a whitespace character and `{2,}` means "match at least 2 of the preceding element". This allows the pattern to skip over an area of the string that contains at least two spaces.
- `(\d+)` captures one or more digit characters. `\d` represents any digit (0-9) and `+` means "one or more of the preceding element". This is another capturing group, and is used to capture the `Cost`.
- `.+(\d+).(+\d+)` matches one or more of any character (which is ignored), followed by one or more digits, followed again by one or more of any character (which is ignored), and finally ending with one or more digits. The digits are expected to be captured. They represent the `Damage` and `Armor`.

We read the input file one line at a time. And whenever we read a "header" row (i.e. containing `Weapons`, `Armor`, or `Rings`), we set a variable accordingly, and use this to add all subsequent items found to the appropriate `dictionary`. In each case, we take the current row, and use it to build an `Item` object, containing the attributes for a given item. We return the results as a `tuple` of three dictionaries.

We call this from our `main()` method like this:

```python
    # Shop contructor takes multiple params.  Splat the tuple to pass these in.
    shop = Shop(*process_shop_items(data))
```

This line is interesting, because I'm using the [splat](/python/zip#unpacking-an-arbitrary-number-of-iterables) operator to unpack the returned `tuple` to its three constituent dictionaries, and passes these into the `__init__()` method of our my `Shop` class.  More on that class later.

Now, let's look at my `Loadout` class:

```python
class Loadout:
    """ A valid combination of weapon, armor, and rings. """
    
    def __init__(self, item_names: list, items: list):
        """ Initialise a loadout.

        Args:
            item_names (list): A list of item names
            items (list): _description_
        """
        self._item_names = item_names # E.g. ['Dagger', None, 'Damage +1', 'Damage +2']
        self._items = items # The Items
        self._cost = 0 # computed
        self._damage = 0 # computed
        self._armor = 0 # computed
        self._compute_attributes()

    @property
    def cost(self) -> int:
        return self._cost

    @property
    def damage(self) -> int:
        return self._damage

    @property
    def armor(self) -> int:
        return self._armor

    def _compute_attributes(self):
        """ Compute the total cost, damage and armor of this Loadout """
        an_item:Item
        for an_item in self._items:
            self._cost += an_item.cost
            self._damage += an_item.damage
            self._armor += an_item.armor

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Loadout: {self._item_names}, cost: {self._cost}, damage: {self._damage}, armor: {self._armor}"
```

I've defined a `Loadout` to be any valid combination of _weapon_, _armor_ and _rings_. (We'll create the valid loadouts later, in the `Shop` class.)

A few notes about `Loadout`:

- When initialising, we pass in a `list` of item names, and the corresponding `list` of Items.
- We then call `self._compute_attributes()` to compute the attributes of this `Loadout`, i.e. the total `cost`, `damage` and `armor` values of this `Loadout`.  Note how this method starts with `_`, indicating that it is intended to be a _private_ method, and should only be used by the internal implementation of this class.  This method should not be called from outside the class.
- The `self._compute_attributes()` method iterates through the `Item` objects, and incrementally updates the attributes each time. Thus, we now know the `cost`, `damage` and `armor` of each `Loadout`.
- I expose the `cost`, `damage` and `armor` attributes as _properties_, using the `@property` decorator.

Now let's look at the `Shop` class:

```python
class Shop:
    """ Represents all the items that can be bought in the shop """

    def __init__(self, weapons: dict, armor: dict, rings: dict):
        """ Stores all_items as a dict to map the item name to the properties.
        Then computes all valid combinations of items, as 'loadouts'
        """
        self._weapons = weapons # {'Dagger': Item(name='Dagger', cost=8, damage=4, armor=0)}
        self._armor = armor     # {'Leather': Item(name='Leather', cost=13, damage=0, armor=1)}
        self._rings = rings     # {'Damage +1': }

        self._all_items = weapons | armor | rings # merge dictionaries
        
        self._loadouts = self._create_loadouts()

    def _create_loadouts(self):
        """ Computes all valid loadouts, given the items available in the shop. Rules:
            - All loadouts have one and only one weapon
            - Loadouts can have zero or one armor
            - Loadouts can have zero, one or two rings.  (But each ring can only be used once.)
        """
        loadouts = []        
        weapon_options = list(self._weapons) # Get a list of the weapon names
        armor_options = [None] + list(self._armor) # Get a list of the 6 allowed armor options

        # build up the ring options.  Start by adding zero or one ring options.
        # E.g. [[None], [Damage +1], [Damage +2]...]
        ring_options = [[None]] + [[ring] for ring in self._rings] 
        # And now add combinations (without duplicates) if using two rings
        for combo in combinations(self._rings, 2):
            ring_options.append([combo[0], combo[1]]) # Append, e.g. ['Damage +1', 'Damage +2']

        # Now we have 5 weapons, 6 armors, and 22 different ring combos
        # smash our valid options together to get a list with three items
        # Then perform cartesian product to get all ways of combining these three lists (= 660 combos)
        all_items = [weapon_options, armor_options, ring_options]
        all_loadouts_combos: list[tuple] = list(itertools.product(*all_items))

        # Our product is a tuple with always three items, which looks like (weapon, armor, [rings])
        # Where [rings] can have [None], one or two rings.  
        # We need to flatten this list, into... [weapon, armor, ring1...]
        for weapon, armor, rings in all_loadouts_combos: 
            # e.g. 'Dagger', 'Leather', ['Damage +1', 'Damage +2']
            # Flatten to ['Dagger', 'Leather', 'Damage +1', 'Damage +2']
            loadout_item_names = [weapon] + [armor] + list(rings)
            
            # now use the item name to retrieve the actual Items for this loadout
            items = []
            for item_name in loadout_item_names:
                if item_name is not None:
                    an_item = self._all_items[item_name]
                    items.append(an_item)

            # And build a Loadout object, passing in the item names (for identification) and the items themselves
            loadout = Loadout(loadout_item_names, items)
            loadouts.append(loadout)
        
        return loadouts

    def get_loadouts(self) -> list[Loadout]:
        """ Get the valid loadouts that can be assembled from shop items """
        return self._loadouts
```

The interesting thing about this class is the `_create_loadouts()` method. The goal of this method is to create all the possible Loadout instances that are allowed, according to the rules. It works like this:

- We start with a list of weapons; there are five possible weapons.
- Then we create a list of the armor options. There are six, because `None` is a valid armor configuration.
- Then we determine all the ring combinations that are possible:
  - We start with `None`, plus the six single ring options.
  - Then we add the dual ring combinations. There are 15 dual ring combinations.
- We take this three lists, and combine them into one list, containing three lists.
- We use [`itertools.product()`](/python/perms_combos#product) to obtain the cartesian product of combining all the items from these three lists. This returns `5*6*22 = 660` different combinations of items.
- For each combination, we then flatten in a single flattened list.
- We iterate over each item name in the list, and use it to retrieve the matching `Item`, and we add this `Item` to the list of items that make up this `Loadout`.
- Finally, we build a valid `Loadout` using these items, and add it to the list of valid Loadouts that will eventually be returned.

Okay, so now we know every valid combination of items that a player can start out with. Now I create a `Player` class, which is used to set the player's initial state. Note that we will always need to define two players:

1. Our player.  We will want to be able to try various different loadouts, in order to find the loadout that can win for the lowest cost.
1. The boss.  The stats for the boss are fixed, and are given in our input.

Here's the `Player` class I created initially:

```python
class Player:
    """A player has three key attributes:
      hit_points (life) - When this reaches 0, the player has been defeated
      damage - Attack strength
      armor - Attack defence

    Damage done per attack = this player's damage - opponent's armor.  (With a min of 1.)
    Hit_points are decremented by an enemy attack.
    """
    def __init__(self, name: str, hit_points: int, damage: int, armor: int):
        self._name = name
        self._hit_points = hit_points
        self._damage = damage
        self._armor = armor

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @property
    def hit_points(self) -> int:
        return self._hit_points

    @property
    def armor(self) -> int:
        return self._armor

    def take_hit(self, loss: int):
        """ Remove this hit from the current hit points """
        self._hit_points -= loss

    def is_alive(self) -> bool:
        return self._hit_points > 0

    def _damage_inflicted_on_opponent(self, other_player: Player) -> int:
        """Damage inflicted in an attack.  Given by this player's damage minus other player's armor.
        Returns: damage inflicted per attack """
        return max(self._damage - other_player.armor, 1)

    def attack(self, other_player: Player):
        """ Perform an attack on another player, inflicting damage """
        attack_damage = self._damage_inflicted_on_opponent(other_player)
        other_player.take_hit(attack_damage)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.__repr__()
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Player: {self._name}, hit points={self._hit_points}, damage={self._damage}, armor={self._armor}"
```

It's fairly self-explanatory.

- It stores the initial stats of the player, i.e. _hit points_, _damage_, _armor_.
- The `take_hit()` method reduces our _hit points_.
- The `_damage_inflicted_on_opponent()` method calculates the effectiveness of an attack; i.e. the number of _hit points_ that will be reduced by `take_hit()`.
- Finally, the `attack()` method is how a player takes their turn. It calls `_damage_inflicted_on_opponent()`, and then calls `take_hit()` against the opponent's `Player` instance.
- The class has an `is_alive()` method to determine if the player has been defeated.

We can read in the boss stats like this:

```python
def process_boss_input(data:list[str]):
    """ Process boss file input and return tuple of hit_points, damage and armor """
    boss = {}
    for line in data:
        key, val = line.strip().split(":")
        boss[key] = int(val)

    return boss['Hit Points'], boss['Damage'], boss['Armor']
```

And then, in our `main()` method:

```python
    hit_points, damage, armor = process_boss_input(data)
    boss = Player("Boss", hit_points=hit_points, damage=damage, armor=armor)
```

And we can create every possible initial player starting state, like this:

```python
    # Get the valid loadouts
    loadouts = shop.get_loadouts()

    # Create a player using each loadout
    for loadout in loadouts:
        player = Player("Player", hit_points=100, damage=loadout.damage, armor=loadout.armor)
```

_One way_ to now solve Part 1 is to simply _play the game_ with each possible player. I.e.

```python
    # Create a player using each loadout
    for loadout in loadouts:
        player = Player("Player", hit_points=100, damage=loadout.damage, armor=loadout.armor)
        player_wins = play_game(player, boss)
```

Then we would need to implement a `play_game()` function, which returns `True` if our player is still alive at the end of the game, but `False` if our player has been defeated. It could look like this:

```python
def play_game(player: Player, opponent: Player) -> bool:
    """Performs a game, given two players. Determines if player1 wins, vs boss.

    Args:
        player (Player): The player
        enemy (Player): The opponent

    Returns:
        bool: Whether player wins
    """
    boss = copy.deepcopy(opponent)
    logger.debug("Playing...")
    i = 1
    current_player = player
    other_player = boss
    while (player.hit_points > 0 and boss.hit_points > 0):
        current_player.attack(other_player)
        logger.debug("%s round %d", current_player.name, i)
        logger.debug(other_player)
        if current_player == boss:
            i += 1

        current_player, other_player = other_player, current_player
    
    return player.is_alive()
```

The function works by looping for as long as both players are still alive. As soon as one player has been defeated (i.e. _hit points_ now not greater than 0), then the loop ends, and we return whether our player is alive or not.  Note that at the of each loop, we swap the two players around. This is how we alternate who is attacking.

But it turns out this is very inefficient.  We don't actually need to play a complete game for each pairing of player and boss. Instead, we can simply determine how many attacks are needed to defeat a given player, by calculating their starting _hit points_ divided by their opponent's effective attack damage. If our player needs fewer (or the same) attacks than the boss, then our player will win. (The same number of attacks will win, because our player always goes first.)

So, we need to add these methods to our `Player` class:

```python
    def get_attacks_needed(self, other_player: Player) -> int:
        """ The number of attacks needed for this player to defeat the other player. """
        return ceil(other_player.hit_points / self._damage_inflicted_on_opponent(other_player))

    def will_defeat(self, other_player: Player) -> bool:
        """ Determine if this player will win a fight with an opponent.
        I.e. if this player needs fewer (or same) attacks than the opponent.
        Assumes this player always goes first. """
        return (self.get_attacks_needed(other_player) 
                <= other_player.get_attacks_needed(self))
```

And now, finally, we can solve for Part 1 efficiently.  We update our `main()` method like this:

```python
    # Create a player using each loadout
    loadouts_tried = []
    for loadout in loadouts:
        player = Player("Player", hit_points=100, damage=loadout.damage, armor=loadout.armor)
        player_wins = player.will_defeat(boss)

        # Store the loadout we've tried, in a list with item that look like [loadout, success]
        loadouts_tried.append([loadout, player_wins])
    
    # Part 1
    winning_loadouts = [loadout for loadout, player_wins in loadouts_tried if player_wins]
    cheapest_winning_loadout = min(winning_loadouts, key=lambda loadout: loadout.cost)
    logger.info("Cheapest win = %s", cheapest_winning_loadout)
```

This code creates a `Player` for each possible `Loadout`, and then determines if the player will win against the boss.  I save the result with each `Loadout` in the `loadouts_tried` list.

We then use a _list comprehension_ to return only _winning loadouts_.  And finally, we use the `min()` function, and set the key to be a [lambda](/python/functions#lambda-functions) which is defined as the `cost` attribute of a `Loadout` instance.

## Part 2

**What is the most amount of gold you can spend and still lose the fight?**

Phew!  Given the code we already have, this requires a trivial addition:

```python
    # Part 2
    losing_loadouts = [loadout for loadout, player_wins in loadouts_tried if not player_wins]
    priciest_losing_loadout = max(losing_loadouts, key=lambda loadout: loadout.cost)
    logger.info("Priciest loss = %s", priciest_losing_loadout)
```

It's the same code as Part 1.  But this time, we want all the loadouts where we lost, and then we want to find the one where the cost was highest.

## Results

And when we run it...
