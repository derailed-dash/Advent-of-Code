## Problem Intro

We need to perfect the milk-dunking cookie recipe by finding the right balance of ingredients.  We must combine ingredients such that we use exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients.

Each ingredient comprises a set of properties and property values.  The properties are: capacity, durability, flavor, texture, and calories.

Our puzzle input looks something like this:

```text
Butterscotch: capacity -1, durability -2, flavor 6, texture 3, calories 8
Cinnamon: capacity 2, durability 3, flavor -2, texture -1, calories 3
```

The score of a given recipe is given by:
- For each property, the total property score = sum of [qty ingredient * ingredient property value]
- Then obtain the product of the total property scores. (Negative property scores are set to 0.)

## Part 1

**Ignoring the calorie property, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?**
