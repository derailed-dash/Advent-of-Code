## Problem Intro

We need to perfect the milk-dunking cookie recipe by finding the right balance of ingredients.  We must combine ingredients such that we use exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients.

Each ingredient is made up of five properties and their associated property scores.
There are five properties, and these are: capacity, durability, flavor, texture, and calories.

Our puzzle input looks something like this:

```text
Butterscotch: capacity -1, durability -2, flavor 6, texture 3, calories 8
Cinnamon: capacity 2, durability 3, flavor -2, texture -1, calories 3
```

```
Score of each property = qty_ingr1 * ingr1_property_score
                         + qty_ingr2 * ingr2_property_score
                         + qty_ingr3 * ingr3_property_score ... 
```
                         
(Or 0 if property score is -ve.)

Then, the overall cookie score = product of all properties

## Part 1

**Ignoring the calorie property, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?**

I found this one quite difficult!  I solved it quite a few ways, but here I write about the one that was a) fastest and b) had the least code!

This solution uses the [subset with sum pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subsets-with-sum-equal-to-x-using-recursion/){:target="_blank"}.

Let's start with how we read in the ingredients:

```python
    ingredients = []
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        p = re.compile(r'^([A-Za-z]+): capacity (-?[0-9]+), durability (-?[0-9]+), flavor (-?[0-9]+), texture (-?[0-9]+), calories (-?[0-9]+)$')
        for line in f:
            name, cap, dur, flav, text, cal = p.findall(line.strip())[0]
            cap, dur, flav, text, cal = map(int, [cap, dur, flav, text, cal])
            ingredients.append({NAME: name, CAPACITY: cap, DURABILITY: dur, FLAVOR: flav, TEXTURE: text, CALORIES: cal})

    for ingredient in ingredients:
        print(ingredient)
```

- First, we define our [regex](/python/regex) pattern.
  - `^` means start from the beginning of hte line.
  - `([A-Za-z]+):` means match a string with at least one alphabetic char, ending with `:`, and return it as a group. This is how we get the name of the ingredient.
  - Then we simply retrieve each property in turn, and we get the value of each property using `(-?[0-9]+)`.  This means: grab the next number, which may optionally start with `-`.

- We apply this regex to each line in the input data.  The regex returns six groups: the name, and the five property values.
- We then use the `map()` function convert the five numeric property values from `str` to `int`.
- Finally, we create a `dict` from the ingredient name and its five property int values, and we add this `dict` to the `list` of ingredients.

When we print out the ingredients we've parsed, it looks something like this:

```text
{'Name': 'Sprinkles', 'capacity': 5, 'durability': -1, 'flavor': 0, 'texture': 0, 'calories': 5}
{'Name': 'PeanutButter', 'capacity': -1, 'durability': 3, 'flavor': 0, 'texture': 0, 'calories': 1}       
{'Name': 'Frosting', 'capacity': 0, 'durability': -1, 'flavor': 4, 'texture': 0, 'calories': 6}
{'Name': 'Sugar', 'capacity': -1, 'durability': 0, 'flavor': 0, 'texture': 2, 'calories': 8}
```
