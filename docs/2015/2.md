## Solution Intro

The elves need more wrapping paper.

We're given the dimensions (length, width, height) of a list of presents, where dimensions are given in feet. E.g.

```text
2x3x4
1x1x10
```

Every present is a _rectangular cuboid_, so we know the area is given by `2(lw + wh + lh)`.

## Part 1

The elves need enough paper to wrap all the presents. They require some extra paper: the area of the smallest side of each present.

**How many total square feet of wrapper paper should they order?**



## Part 2
