## Problem Intro

We need to devise a system that automatically generates a password based on the previous password.  We need to generate new passwords by _incrementing_ password characters from the rightmost character, in the same way that we would increment a number. Each new password must be exactly 8 lowercase characters.  In addition, we're giving a set of rules to match.

The input is simply the initial password we need to increment from.  E.g.

```text
cqjxjnds
```

This is fairly simple. We can do all the necessary string rule matching using [regex](/python/regex). The slightly tricker bit is how we increment the string. I've elected to do this with some [recursion](/python/recursion).

## Part 1

We're provided with a set of rules:

- Must have one _straight_ of at least three characters.  E.g. `cde`.
- Must not contain the letters `i`, `o`, `l`.
- Must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs, e.g. `aa` and `zz`.

**Given Santa's current password (the puzzle input), what should his next password be?**

First, I define the rules we need to match against, using regular expressions:

```python
# validate straight
STRAIGHT_MATCH = re.compile(r"abc|bcd|cde|def|efg|fgh|ghi|hij|ijk|jkl|klm|lmn|mno|nop|opq|pqr|qrs|rst|stu|tuv|uvw|vwx|wxy|xyz")
# Two non-overlapping pairs of any character
PAIRS_CHARS_MATCH = re.compile(r"(.)\1.*(.)\2")
# match any of i, o, u
BAD_CHARS_MATCH = re.compile(r"[iol]")
```

Rules explained:

- The first one is obvious.  It's just a bunch of _straights_ and we need to match against any one of them.
- The second is a bit more tricky.  
  - We use `"(.)\1"` to mean: _match any character, and then any subsequent character that is the same._ So this would match `aa`, `bb`, etc.
  - Then we use `".*"` to match 0 or more intervening characters.
  - Then we use `"(.)\2"` to mean: _match any character, and then any subsequent character that is the same._ It's the same as the first rule, but uses `"\2"`, since we're now matching against second group, rather than the first group.
  - Note that as it stands, the `PAIRS_CHARS_MATCH` will match any string that contains two non-overlapping pairs, but it doesn't check if the pairs are different.  So, `aaghiaa` would match okay. But we need this to _not_ be okay. We'll deal with that later, in the code.

Now I create a function that checks our rules:

```python
def check_rules(input):
    if not STRAIGHT_MATCH.search(input):
        return False

    if BAD_CHARS_MATCH.search(input):
        return False
        
    two_pairs_match = PAIRS_CHARS_MATCH.search(input)
    if not two_pairs_match:
        return False
    else:
        pair_one, pair_two = two_pairs_match.groups()
        if pair_one == pair_two:
            # the two pairs must be different, e.g. aa and bb, but not aa and aa
            return False

    return True
```

This function passes in the password we want to check, and then checks it against our three regular expressions.  If any of these expressions doesn't much, then the function returns `False`.  The only point worth mentioning is that when we're applying the `PAIRS_CHARS_MATCH` rule, we check the two groups returned by any match, to determine if they are _different_.  For example, if we applied this rule against `aaefgaa`, the regex would return two groups: `aa` and `aa`. If the two pairs are the same, then our rule has failed, and we return `False`.

Finally, if we've satisfied all the rules, we return `True`.

Next, I create a function that is able to increment the password.

```python
def increment_pwd(pwd):
    # increment password char from the rightmost column
    last_col = len(pwd) - 1
    char = pwd[last_col]
    left_pwd = pwd[:last_col]
    new_char = next_char(char)

    if (new_char) == 'a':
        # We've rolled over from z to a, so we need to increment one column left
        # So pass in all left pwd chars, exluding rightmost column, and call this method recursively
        left_pwd = increment_pwd(left_pwd)
    
    new_pwd = left_pwd + new_char
    return new_pwd
```

It works like this:
