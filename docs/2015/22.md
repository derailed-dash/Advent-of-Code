## Problem Intro

Following on from [Day 21](/2015/21){:target="_blank"}, we're asked to turn our RPG simulator into a Wizard Fight Simulator!

**_This was the worst!_**

It took me hours to write write. It works, but it takes a few hours to run!  I think I should probably have used a depth-first search to minimise the solution space.  But anyway, here goes...

Rules:
- The player and boss take alternating turns, and the player goes first.
- If a player's _hit points_ is reduced to 0 or less, then that player loses.
- The boss continues to use _mundane_ (non-magical) attacks, but the _player_ is a _wizard_ and instead casts spells.
- The player starts with 50 _hit points_ and 500 _mana_. The _mana_ is the currency for casting spells.
- The boss still starts with _hit points_ and _attack damage_. Boss armor is irrelevant, since player spells ignore armor.
- The player has magical armor, which depends on spells cast. The armor is used to reduce the effectiveness of the boss's mundane attacks, just as before. Minimum attack damage is 1, as before.
- The player chooses a spell to cast on their turn. If the player does not have enough mana to cast a spell, the player loses. Mana is immediate deduced when a spell is cast.
- Effects last for `n` turns.  The effect timer is started on turn `n`, but begin applying on turn `n+1`. Effects apply at the _start_ of _both turns_, i.e. player and boss. The turn timer is decreased _after the effect is applied_. The effect ends as soon as the timer reaches 0.
- It is not permitted to start an effect that is already active. But an effect can be started on the same turn that the effect ends.

Spell details:

|Spell|Mana Cost|Description|
|-----|---------|-----------|
|Magic missiles|53| Does 4 instant damage |
|Drain|73| Does 2 instant damage and adds 2 _hit points_ |
|Shield|113| Effect: effective armor is increased by 7 for 6 turns |
|Poison|173| Effect: deals 3 damage at the start of the turn, for 6 turns |
|Recharge|229| Effect: adds 101 mana at the start of each turn, for 5 turns |

## Part 1

Boss stats are given in the input.

**What is the least amount of mana you can spend and still win the fight?**

(The _mana recharge_ effect does not count as "spending" _negative_ mana.)

First, I can re-use my `Player` class from [day 21](/2015/21):

```python
class Player:
    """A player has three key attributes:
      hit_points (life) - When this reaches 0, the player has been defeated
      damage - Attack strength
      armor - Attack defence

    Hit_points are decremented by an enemy attack.
    """
    def __init__(self, name: str, hit_points: int, damage: int, armor: int):
        self._name = name
        self._hit_points = hit_points
        self._damage = damage
        self._armor = armor

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @property
    def hit_points(self) -> int:
        return self._hit_points

    @property
    def armor(self) -> int:
        return self._armor

    @property
    def damage(self) -> int:
        return self._damage
    
    def take_hit(self, loss: int):
        """ Remove this hit from the current hit points """
        self._hit_points -= loss

    def is_alive(self) -> bool:
        return self._hit_points > 0

    def _damage_inflicted_on_opponent(self, other_player: Player) -> int:
        """Damage inflicted in an attack.  Given by this player's damage minus other player's armor.

        return max(self._damage - other_player.armor, 1)

    def get_attacks_needed(self, other_player: Player) -> int:
        """ The number of attacks needed for this player to defeat the other player. """
        return ceil(other_player.hit_points / self._damage_inflicted_on_opponent(other_player))

    def will_defeat(self, other_player: Player) -> bool:
        """ Determine if this player will win a fight with an opponent.
        I.e. if this player needs fewer (or same) attacks than the opponent.
        Assumes this player always goes first. """
        return (self.get_attacks_needed(other_player) 
                <= other_player.get_attacks_needed(self))

    def attack(self, other_player: Player):
        """ Perform an attack on another player, inflicting damage """
        attack_damage = self._damage_inflicted_on_opponent(other_player)
        other_player.take_hit(attack_damage)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.__repr__()
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Player: {self._name}, hit points={self._hit_points}, damage={self._damage}, armor={self._armor}"
```

Nothing more to say about that!

Next, a bunch of useful _spell_ stuff:

```python
@dataclass
class SpellAttributes:
    """ Define the attributes of a Spell """
    name: str
    mana_cost: int
    effect_duration: int
    is_effect: bool
    heal: int
    damage: int
    armor: int
    mana_regen: int
    delay_start: int
    
class SpellType(Enum):
    """ Possible spell types. 
    Any given spell_type.value will return an instance of SpellAttributes. """
    
    MAGIC_MISSILES = SpellAttributes('MAGIC_MISSILES', 53, 0, False, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0)
    DRAIN = SpellAttributes('DRAIN', 73, 0, False, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0)
    SHIELD = SpellAttributes('SHIELD', 113, 6, True, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0)
    POISON = SpellAttributes('POISON', 173, 6, True, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0)
    RECHARGE = SpellAttributes('RECHARGE', 229, 5, True, 0, 0, 0, 101, 0)

spell_key_lookup = {
    0: SpellType.MAGIC_MISSILES, # 53
    1: SpellType.DRAIN, # 73
    2: SpellType.SHIELD, # 113
    3: SpellType.POISON, # 173
    4: SpellType.RECHARGE # 229
}

spell_costs = {spell_key: spell_key_lookup[spell_key].value.mana_cost 
               for spell_key, spell_type in spell_key_lookup.items()}
```
The `SpellAttributes` class is simply a _dataclass_ that allows me to define the various properties that make up any given `Spell`. Think of `SpellAttributes` as the _schematic_ for a given spell.  But it is not an instance of a spell.

Then, I use a `SpellTypes` [Enum](/python/enumerate#enum) to create a set of constants, where each `SpellType` constant is mapped to an instance of `SpellAttributes`, with the required properties for that spell. I use this later to make it easier to cast spells of a specific type. So I use `SpellTypes` to simply map each SpellType `Enum` to the five `SpellAttributes`.

Then, a couple of useful variables:

- `spell_key_lookup` is used to map each of our `SpellType` instances to an integer lookup value.
- `spell_costs` is a simple `dictionary` that maps each integer lookup value to just the _mana_ cost of that spell.  This is purely for convenience, and I use it later when calculating the overall _mana_ cost for any combination of attacks. Note that I build this `dictionary` using a [dictionary comprehension](/python/comprehensions#dictionary-comprehension).

Now I go ahead create the `Spell` class:

```python
@dataclass
class Spell:
    """ Spells should be created using create_spell_by_type() factory method.

    Spells have a number of attributes.  Of note:
    - effects last for multiple turns, and apply on both player and opponent turns.
    - duration is the number of turns an effect lasts for
    - mana is the cost of the spell
    """
    name: str
    mana_cost: int
    effect_duration: int
    is_effect: bool
    heal: int = 0
    damage: int = 0
    armor: int = 0
    mana_regen: int = 0
    delay_start: int = 0
    effect_applied_count = 0

    @classmethod
    def check_spell_castable(cls, spell_type: SpellType, wiz: Wizard):
        """ Determine if this Wizard can cast this spell.
        Spell can only be cast if the wizard has sufficient mana, and if the spell is not already active.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the spell is not castable

        Returns:
            [bool]: True if castable
        """

        # not enough mana
        if wiz.mana < spell_type.value.mana_cost:
            raise ValueError(f"Not enough mana for {spell_type}. " \
                                f"Need {spell_type.value.mana_cost}, have {wiz.mana}.")

        # spell already active
        if spell_type in wiz.get_active_effects():
            raise ValueError(f"Spell {spell_type} already active.")
        
        return True
        
    @classmethod
    def create_spell_by_type(cls, spell_type: SpellType):
        # Unpack the spell_type.value, which will be a SpellAttributes class
        # Get all the values, and unpack them, to pass into the factory method.
        attrs_dict = vars(spell_type.value)
        return cls(*attrs_dict.values())
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Spell: {self.name}, cost: {self.mana_cost}, " \
                    f"is effect: {self.is_effect}, remaining duration: {self.duration}"

    def increment_effect_applied_count(self):
        self.effect_applied_count += 1
```

Some interesting things to say about this:

- It has the same properties as the `SpellAttributes` _dataclass_, but additionally has a property called `effect_applied_count`, which I use to track how long an effect has been running for.  When an effect has been running for longer than the `effect_duration`, the effect needs to _fade_.
- I have a method called `check_spell_castable()`, which checks if the supplied `Wizard` can cast this particular spell.  This is defined as a [classmethod](/python/classes#instance-vs-class), because it doesn't depend on the state of _this_ `Spell`. It only needs to check whether the supplied `Wizard` has enough _mana_ to cast the spell, and whether we're trying to start and effect that is already active for that `Wizard`. If the `Wizard` is not able to cast this spell, I [raise an exception programmatically](/python/exceptions#raising-exceptions-programmatically). Specifically, I raise a `ValueError`.  (I'll catch that exception, if my `Wizard` tries to cast such a spell.)
- I have a another _class method_ called `create_spell_by_type()`.  This is a [class factory](/python/classes#factory-pattern): 
  - We pass in one of the `SpellType` constants.
  - The factory method uses `vars()` to obtain all the attributes of the specified `SpellType` as a `dictionary`. The [vars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars) is a cool built-in Python function that allows us to obtain all the attributes of any given class, as a `dictionary`.
  - We then use the built-in `cls()` method, and pass in all the values from that dictionary, to instantiate a new `Spell`.
- I've overridden `__repr__()` so that we can easily see the current state of this `Spell`.

Now the tricky bit: the `Wizard` class.  It overrides the `Player` class with wizard-specific behaviour. There's nothing complicated about this class.  The tricky bit is making sure that spells and effects apply at the _right_ time during a turn. The rules are very specific!

```python
class Wizard(Player):
    """ Extends Player.
    Also has attribute 'mana', which powers spells.
    Wizard has no armor (except when provided by spells) and no inherent damage (except from spells).

```

Things to note:

- The `__init__()` method chains to the parent `__init__()` method, but additionally sets the initial _mana_ value. It also creates a `dictionary` of active _effects_, which is initially empty.
- The `Wizard` has a `use_mana()` method, which raises an _exception_ if the _mana_ required exceeds the _mana_ available.
- The `Wizard` has a `take_turn()` method, which casts a specified `Spell`, but only after applying and fading any _effects_, as required.
- We also have a `opponent_takes_turn()` method, where we similarly apply and fade any _effects_, but do not cast any new spells.
- The `cast_spell()` method:
  - First checks whether the spell is castable, as described earlier.
  - Then creates the `Spell`, using the factory, as described earlier.
  - Then attempts to spend the required amount of _mana_. If there is not enough _mana_, we catch and _re-raise_ the exception.
  - If the new spell is an _effect_, we add it to `self._active_effects`. Otherwise, we do _damage_ or _heal_, as required.
- The `apply_effect()` method loops through any current _effects_, determines if they have any more _duration_ remaining, and if so, increments the duration and then applies the _effect_.
- The `fade_effects()` method is similar.  It loops through any current _effects_, determines if they have exceeded _duration_, and if so, revokes any _effects_, and removes the effect from `self._active_effects`.
- Interestingly, we override `attack()` from `Player`, marking it as unusuble in the `Wizard` class. If we try to call `attack()` from a `Wizard`, an exception is raised.

Most of the hard work is done. Now we're ready to solve the problem!

Next, I'll create a function that generates successive attack combinations to try. It returns each attack combination as a string of digits, where each digit is the key lookup for an attack, e.g. "4013" would mean:

1. `4 = RECHARGE`
1. `0 = MAGIC MISSILES`
1. `1 = DRAIN`
1. `3 = POISON`

```python
def attack_combos_generator(count_different_attacks: int) -> Iterable[str]:
    """ Generator that returns the next attack combo. Pass in the number of different attack types.
    E.g. with 5 different attacks, it will generate...
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, etc
    """
    i = 0
    while True:
        # convert i to base-n (where n is the number of attacks we can choose from) 
        yield td.to_base_n(i, count_different_attacks)
        i += 1
```

Note that this is a _generator_. It increments the value of `i` with each call. And it is infinite. Later, we'll use this generator in a loop, and we'll need an exit condition, otherwise this will loop forever.

My generator also calls a new `to_base_n()` function, which I've moved to my common `type_defs.py` module. It converts any supplied number to a supplied base, and then returns the `str` representation of that number.
Here, I'm using it convert to base-5.  Why?  Because I have 5 unique attack types, and I want my attack lookup string to contain only the digits `0` to `4`.  So my `to_base_n()` function does this conversion:

|Decimal Number|In Base-5|
|--------------|---------|
|0|0|
|1|1|
|2|2|
|3|3|
|4|4|
|5|10|
|6|11|
|7|12|
|8|13|
|9|14|
|10|20|
|11|21|
|12|21|

Now I create a method that calculates the overall _mana_ cost for any given attack sequence. Why? Because if we're testing an attack sequence that has a higher cost than a previous winning attack sequence, then there's no point in even trying it.  It saves us playing the game with this sequence.

```python
@cache # I think there are only about 3000 different sorted attacks
def get_combo_mana_cost(attack_combo_lookup: str) -> int:
    """ Pass in attack combo lookup str, and return the cost of this attack combo.
    Ideally, the attack combo lookup should be sorted, because cost doesn't care about attack order;
    and providing a sorted value, we can use a cache. """
    return sum(spell_costs[int(attack)] for attack in attack_combo_lookup)
```

It works by using a _list comprehension_ to obtain the integer value of each digit in the attack sequence, and then summing them.

The interesting thing about this `get_combo_mana_cost()` is that it caches the calculated cost for a given attack sequence. But every attack sequence is unique, so why bother caching? Well, although every attack sequence is unique, the _cost_ of a given sequence only depends on the attacks contained, not in the order of those attacks.  So, if I sort each attack before checking its cost, it turns out that there are only a few thousand unique costs, and it's very efficient to cache these.

Now let's read in the boss stats from the input data:

```python
def main():
    # boss stats are determined by an input file
    with open(path.join(locations.input_dir, BOSS_FILE), mode="rt") as f:
        boss_hit_points, boss_damage = process_boss_input(f.read().splitlines())
        actual_boss = Player("Actual Boss", hit_points=boss_hit_points, damage=boss_damage, armor=0)

    player = Wizard("Bob", hit_points=50, mana=500)

    winning_games, least_winning_mana = try_combos(actual_boss, player)

    message = "Winning solutions:\n" + "\n".join(f"Mana: {k}, Attack: {v}" for k, v in winning_games.items())
    logger.info(message)
    logger.info("We found %d winning solutions. Lowest mana cost was %d.", len(winning_games), least_winning_mana)

def process_boss_input(data:list[str]) -> tuple:
    """ Process boss file input and return tuple of hit_points, damage

    Returns:
        tuple: hit_points, damage
    """
    boss = {}
    for line in data:
        key, val = line.strip().split(":")
        boss[key] = int(val)

    return boss['Hit Points'], boss['Damage']
```

Recall that the input data looks something like this:

```text
Hit Points: 71
Damage: 10
```

So we read each line, split the line at the `:` to return the key and its value. Convert the value to an `int`, and store it in a `dictionary` called `boss`. Finally, return the two values in this dictionary, as a `tuple`. We use these two values to construct a new `Player` called _Actual Boss_.

And, of course, we create a `Wizard` to represent our player.

Then we need to try out the attack sequence combinations:

```python
def try_combos(boss_stats: Player, plyr_stats: Wizard):
    logger.info(boss_stats)
    logger.info(plyr_stats)    

    winning_games = {}
    least_winning_mana = 2500 # ball-park of what will likely be larger than winning solution
    ignore_combo = "9999999"
    player_has_won = False
    last_attack_len = 0
    
    # This is an infinite generator, so we need an exit condition
    for attack_combo_lookup in attack_combos_generator(len(spell_key_lookup)): 
        # play the game with this attack combo
        
        # since attack combos are returned sequentially, 
        # we can ignore any that start with the same attacks as the last failed combo.
        if attack_combo_lookup.startswith(ignore_combo):
            continue
        
        # determine if the cost of the current attack is going to be more than an existing
        # winning solution. (Sort it, so we can cache the attack cost.)
        sorted_attack = ''.join(sorted(attack_combo_lookup))
        if get_combo_mana_cost(sorted_attack) >= least_winning_mana:
            continue
        
        # Much faster than a deep copy
        boss = Player(boss_stats.name, boss_stats.hit_points, boss_stats.damage, boss_stats.armor)
        player = Wizard(plyr_stats.name, plyr_stats.hit_points, plyr_stats.mana)
    
        if player_has_won and logger.getEffectiveLevel() == logging.DEBUG:
            logger.debug("Best winning attack: %s. Total mana: %s. Current attack: %s", 
                        winning_games[least_winning_mana], least_winning_mana, attack_combo_lookup)
        else:
            logger.debug("Current attack: %s", attack_combo_lookup)

        player_won, mana_consumed, rounds_started = play_game(
                attack_combo_lookup, player, boss, mana_target=least_winning_mana)
        
        if player_won:
            player_has_won = True
            winning_games[mana_consumed] = attack_combo_lookup
            least_winning_mana = min(mana_consumed, least_winning_mana)
            logger.info("Found a winning solution, with attack %s consuming %d", attack_combo_lookup, mana_consumed)
        
        attack_len = len(attack_combo_lookup)
        if (attack_len > last_attack_len):
            if player_has_won:
                # We can't play forever. Assume that if the last attack length didn't yield a better result
                # then we're not going to find a better solution.
                if len(attack_combo_lookup) > len(winning_games[least_winning_mana]) + 1:
                    logger.info("Probably not getting any better. Exiting.")
                    break # We're done!
                
            logger.info("Trying attacks of length %d", attack_len)
        
        last_attack_len = attack_len

        # we can ingore any attacks that start with the same attacks as what we tried last time
        ignore_combo = attack_combo_lookup[0:rounds_started]
        
    return winning_games, least_winning_mana
```

Things to say about this...

- We store a `dictionary` to store all winning games, where the key is the mana consumed, and the value is the attack combination.
- We use our combos generator to loop infinitely, through all possible attack sequences. In the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, etc.  In the loop:
  - Calculate the total cost of the current attack, using a cache. If this is more costly than a winning solution, ignore it and skip to the next attack sequence.
  - If not, then it's a candidate. Create a new instance of the _boss_ and the _player_, in order to play the game.
  - Play the game, passing in our attack sequence, our two players, and the lowest scoring _mana_ so far. The point of passing in the _mana_ is so that our `play_game()` function can exit if we consume more than the least amount of _mana_.
  - If this turns out to be a winning attack, store it in our `winning_games` dictionary, and keep track of the least _mana_ of any winning game so far.
  - Check if our current attack sequence is more than 1 _longer_ than current best attack sequence. If it is, then it means that attacks of lenth `n+1` didn't give us an attack sequence that had a lower cost than attacks of length `n`.  At this point, it's extremely unlikely that attacks of length `n+2` will do better, so we can exit.
- Once we exit the loop, return our `dictionary` of winning games, and the least mana consumed for any winning game.

Finally, this is how we actually play the game:

```python
def play_game(attack_combo_lookup: str, player: Wizard, boss: Player, **kwargs) -> tuple[bool, int, int]:
    """ Play a game, given a player (Wizard) and an opponent (boss)

    Args:

        boss (Player): A mundane opponent
        hard_mode (Bool): Whether each player turn automatically loses 1 hit point
        mana_target (int): optional arg, that specifies a max mana consumed value which triggers a return

    Returns:
        tuple[bool, int, int]: player won, mana consumed, number of rounds
    """
    
    # Convert the attack combo to a list of spells. E.g. convert '00002320'
    # to [<SpellType.MAGIC_MISSILES: ..., <SpellType.MAGIC_MISSILES: ..., 
    #    ... <SpellType.SHIELD: ..., <SpellType.MAGIC_MISSILES: ... >]
    attacks = [spell_key_lookup[int(attack)] for attack in attack_combo_lookup]    

    game_round = 1
    current_player = player
    other_player = boss    

    mana_consumed: int = 0
    mana_target = kwargs.get('mana_target', None)

    while (player.hit_points > 0 and boss.hit_points > 0):
        if current_player == player:
            # player (wizard) attack
            if logger.getEffectiveLevel() == logging.DEBUG:
                logger.debug("")
                logger.debug("Round %s...", game_round)
                logger.debug("%s's turn:", current_player.name)
    
            try:
                mana_consumed += player.take_turn(attacks[game_round-1], boss)
                if mana_target and mana_consumed > mana_target:
                    logger.debug('Mana target %s exceeded; mana consumed=%s.', mana_target, mana_consumed)
                    return False, mana_consumed, game_round
            except ValueError as err:
                logger.debug(err)
                return False, mana_consumed, game_round
            except IndexError:
                logger.debug("No more attacks left.")
                return False, mana_consumed, game_round

        else:
            logger.debug("%s's turn:", current_player.name)
            # effects apply before opponent attacks
            player.opponent_takes_turn(boss)
            if boss.hit_points <= 0:
                logger.debug("Effects killed %s!", boss.name)
                continue

            boss.attack(other_player)
            game_round += 1
        
        if logger.getEffectiveLevel() == logging.DEBUG:
            logger.debug("End of turn: %s", player)
            logger.debug("End of turn: %s", boss)

        # swap players
        current_player, other_player = other_player, current_player

    player_won = player.hit_points > 0
    return player_won, mana_consumed, game_round
```

This works by letting each player take a turn, and then swapping which player is the current player. It loops until one of the players no longer has any _hit points_. If we exit the loop and the player still has _hit points_, then the player has won.

And that's it!

## Part 2

Now we're told to play the game in _hard_mode. The player loses 1 hit point with each turn.

As before:

**What is the least amount of mana you can spend and still win the fight?**

Fortunately, the changes required here are trivial.

In `play_game()`, I just add this before the player takes their turn:

```python
            if hard_mode:
                logger.debug("Hard mode hit. Player hit points reduced by 1.")
                player.take_hit(1)
                if player.hit_points <= 0:
                    logger.debug("Hard mode killed %s", boss.name)
                    continue
```

And add a `hard_mode` parameter to the function signature:

```python
def play_game(attack_combo_lookup: str, player: Wizard, boss: Player, hard_mode=False, **kwargs) -> tuple[bool, int, int]:
```

## Testing

There's so much that can wrong in this code. I thought it was sensible to have unit tests that would allow me to validate the code is working correctly, but also to check that I'm not breaking anything when refactoring.

So here's my test:

```python
""" Unit testing for Spell_Casting

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Some things to say about this...

- I've overridden the `run()` method to include some default printing of the test name, with each test.
- I test playing the game with various attack sequences, and assert whether we win or lose, the _mana_ consumed, and how many rounds were required.

It's quick to run, and easy to change.

## Results

It's not short. It's not even fast.
