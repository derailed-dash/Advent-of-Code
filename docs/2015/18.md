## Problem Intro

We have 10000 lights, arranged in a square grid of 100-by-100. We are given an initial state with some lights turned on (represented by `#`) and same lights off (represented by `.`), e.g.

```text
.#.#.#
...##.
#....#
..#...
#.#..#
####..
```

Now we create an animation, by changing which lights are on and off over a number of steps. With each step:
- Each light's next state (on or off) is dependent on its current state, and the state of the neighbouring eight lights.
- If a light is missing neighbours (because the light is on an edge), then the missing neighbours count as off.
- A light which is on stays on when 2 or 3 neighbors are on, and turns off otherwise.
- A light which is off turns on if exactly 3 neighbors are on, and stays off otherwise.
- All the lights change state at the same time.

## Part 1

**How many lights are on after 100 steps?**
