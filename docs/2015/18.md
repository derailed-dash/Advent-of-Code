## Problem Intro

A bit like the problem for [Day 6](/2015/6){:target="_blank"}, we have a grid of lights to work with.  This time, a 100x100 grid. We need to animate this grid of lights, by turning lights on and off according to instructions.

We're given sample data like this:

```text
.#.#.#
...##.
#....#
..#...
#.#..#
####..
```

- `#` means the light is on.
- `.` means the light is off.

Now we create an animation, by changing which lights are on and off over a number of steps. With each step:
- Each light's next state (on or off) is dependent on its current state, and the state of the neighbouring eight lights.
- If a light is missing neighbours (because the light is on an edge), then the missing neighbours count as off.
- A light which is on stays on when 2 or 3 neighbors are on, and turns off otherwise.
- A light which is off turns on if exactly 3 neighbors are on, and stays off otherwise.
- All the lights change state at the same time.

Thus, this challenge is very much an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life){:target="_blank"}.

As with [Day 6](/2015/6){:target="_blank"}, I've sold this using two solutions:

1. [Using a Point class](#point-class-solution)
2. [Using NumPy](#numpy-solution)

## Point Class Solution

### Part 1

**How many lights are on after 100 steps?**

The solution approach here is pretty simple:
- Read in the input grid
- Using the grid dimensions, create a `set` that contains a `Point` for all (x,y) coordinates in the grid. We'll call this `all_lights`.
- Using the input grid data, create a separate `set` of Points, containing only lights that are currently on. We call this set: `on_lights`.
- Now loop through 100 iterations. For each iteration:
  - Loop through every light in the grid.
  - Find the neighbours for each light, and return as a `set`.
  - Determine how many neighbours are currently turned on, by finding the [intersection](/python/sets) between the neighbours, and the `on_lights`.
  - Apply the rules to determine whether the current line should be turned on or off.

Here's the code that achieves this:

```python
import os
import time
from itertools import product
from common.type_defs import Point

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__) 
INPUT_FILE = "input/input.txt"
SAMPLE_INPUT_FILE = "input/sample_input.txt"

ITERATIONS = 100

def main():
    # input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, SAMPLE_INPUT_FILE)
    input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
    with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read().splitlines()

    # Get all light coordinates by obtaining cartesian product of all x coords with all y coords
    lights_length = len(data[0])
    lights_height = len(data)
    
    all_lights = {Point(*point) 
                  for point in set(product(range(lights_length), range(lights_height)))}

    on_lights = init_state(data)

    # Part 1
    final_on_lights = process_iterations(all_lights, on_lights.copy(), ITERATIONS)
    print(f"Part 1, after {ITERATIONS} iterations, there are {len(final_on_lights)} turned on.")

def process_iterations(all_lights: set[Point], 
                       on_lights: set[Point], 
                       iterations: int) -> set[Point]:
    """ 
    Carry out Conway-like rules for all lights in the all_lights set.

    Args:
        all_lights (Set[Point]): A set of all coords, in an array of width x and height y
        on_lights (Set[Point]): A set containing only coords of lights that are on
        iterations (int): The number of iterations to process the Conway-like rules

    Returns:
        Set[Point]: The coords of lights that are 'on', following specified iterations
    """

    for _ in range(iterations):
        on_lights_to_remove = set()
        on_lights_to_add = set()
        
        for light in all_lights:
            neighbours = light.neighbours()
            on_neighbours = neighbours.intersection(on_lights)
            
            if (light in on_lights):
                if len(on_neighbours) < 2 or len(on_neighbours) > 3:
                    on_lights_to_remove.add(light)
            else:
                if (len(on_neighbours) == 3):
                    on_lights_to_add.add(light)
        
        on_lights.update(on_lights_to_add)
        on_lights.difference_update(on_lights_to_remove)

    return on_lights
    
def init_state(data: list[str]) -> set[Point]:
    on_lights = set()

    for y, line in enumerate(data):
        for x, char in enumerate(line):
            if (char == '#'):
                on_lights.add(Point(x, y))

    return on_lights
```

Some notes about this code:

First, I have imported my reusable `Point` class, which is defined in the module `common.type_defs`.  This `Point` class already knows how to deterine its neighbours, i.e. the Points that it is adjacent to.

Next, I have used a _set comprehension_:

```python
    all_lights = {Point(*point) 
                  for point in set(product(range(lights_length), range(lights_height)))}
```

Imagine our grid was only 3x3.  In this case, the two ranges would both be `[0, 1, 2]`.  Applying `itertools.product()` against these two ranges results in all the possible combinations by taking a value from each range, returned as tuples.  I.e.

```text
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
(1, 2)
(2, 0)
(2, 1)
(2, 2)
```

Thus, we can use this to give us the coordinates of every point in the grid. We then turn each of these tuples into a `Point`, by creating a `Point` from each [unpacked](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unpacking-a-tuple-in-python){:target="_blank"} tuple. This is how we create a `Point` for every coordinate in the grid.

Next, we determine which lights are currently on by looping through each row (`y` value) and each column (`x` value) in the grid, and creating a new `set` of `Point` objects, containing only points where the light is on, i.e. where the value in the grid is `#`.

Now that we have a `set` of `all_lights` and a `set` of `on_lights`, it is trivial to:
- Get the neighbours of each light, as a `set`.
- Use [set algebra](/python/sets) to determine which of these neighbours is _on_.
- Count the number of _on_ neighbours for each `Point`.
- Determine if the `Point` should be _on_ or _off_ accordingly.

### Part 2

We're told that four lights, one in each corner, are stuck on and can't be turned off.

**With the four corners stuck in the on state, how many lights are on after 100 steps?**

This requires some fairly trivial changes.

First, we need to identify the four corners:

```python
    # Part 2
    corner_lights = set()
    corner_lights.add(Point(0, 0))
    corner_lights.add(Point(lights_length-1, 0))
    corner_lights.add(Point(0, lights_height-1))
    corner_lights.add(Point(lights_length-1, lights_height-1))
```

Then, we need to update our `process_iterations()` function, so that it knows to always keep the corners on. I've done this by adding an optional parameter, called `fixed_lights`. It expects a `set` of the Points that need to stay on. If we pass the corners to the function using this parameter, then we simply always add these `fixed_lights` to our `set` of `on_lights`. And when we're processing each light in turn, if the light is one of our `fixed_lights`, we simply do nothing.

```python
def process_iterations(all_lights: set[Point], 
                       on_lights: set[Point], 
                       iterations: int,
                       fixed_lights: set[Point] = None) -> set[Point]:
    """ 
    Carry out Conway-like rules for all lights in the all_lights set.

    Args:
        all_lights (Set[Point]): A set of all coords, in an array of width x and height y
        on_lights (Set[Point]): A set containing only coords of lights that are on
        iterations (int): The number of iterations to process the Conway-like rules
        fixed_lights (Set[Point], optional): Coords of lights that will always be on. Defaults to empty set().

    Returns:
        Set[Point]: The coords of lights that are 'on', following specified iterations
    """

    if not fixed_lights:
        fixed_lights = set()
        
    for _ in range(iterations):
        on_lights_to_remove = set()
        on_lights_to_add = set()

        on_lights.update(fixed_lights)
        
        for light in all_lights:
            neighbours = light.neighbours()
            on_neighbours = neighbours.intersection(on_lights)
            
            if (light in fixed_lights):
                pass   # do nothing
            elif (light in on_lights):
                if len(on_neighbours) < 2 or len(on_neighbours) > 3:
                    on_lights_to_remove.add(light)
            else:
                if (len(on_neighbours) == 3):
                    on_lights_to_add.add(light)
        
        on_lights.update(on_lights_to_add)
        on_lights.difference_update(on_lights_to_remove)

        # print(f"Iteration {_+1}: {len(on_lights)}")

    return on_lights
```

Finally, we run Part 2 like this:

```python
    final_on_lights = process_iterations(all_lights, on_lights.copy(), ITERATIONS, corner_lights)
    print(f"Part 2, after {ITERATIONS} iterations, there are {len(final_on_lights)} turned on.")
```

### Results

The output looks like this:

```text
Part 1, after 100 iterations, there are 821 turned on.
Part 2, after 100 iterations, there are 886 turned on.
Execution time: 14.4660 seconds
```

It works, but it's not particularly quick!

## NumPy Solution 

### Part 1

**How many lights are on after 100 steps?**

Since we're working with a fixed grid of data, and we want to be counting things in that grid, then [NumPy](/python/numpy) is a good library to use. It can save us a lot of coding.

First, let's read the data:

```python
    # inport text as a numpy grid, setting each field to 1 char wide
    grid = np.genfromtxt(input_file, dtype='U1', comments=None, delimiter=1)
    grid[grid == '#'] = 1
    grid[grid == '.'] = 0
    grid = grid.astype(int)
```

The code above reads the text file and converts it to a NumPy array.  We set the `dtype` to `U1`, meaning that the data type for each element will be a single character string.  We also set `comments=None`, because - by default - this method the `#` character as the beginning of a comment. But here, we want to treat `#` as legitimate data.

The next two lines convert all `#` to `1`, and all `.` to `0`. This will be useful when we want to sum values later. Then, we convert the `dtype` of the array to `int`. This allows us to work with the `0` and `1` as integer values, rather than as string representations.

Now let's add a function to count the _on_ neighbours of any given element in the grid:

```python
def count_neighbors(grid, x, y):
    """ Count the _on_ neighbours around the light at coords (x, y). """
    min_x, max_x = max(0, x-1), min(grid.shape[0], x+2)
    min_y, max_y = max(0, y-1), min(grid.shape[1], y+2)
    return np.sum(grid[min_x:max_x, min_y:max_y]) - grid[x, y]
```

The `min_x, max_x` and `min_y, max_y` values are used to return a 3x3 grid of elements around each coordinate.
In both the `x` dimension and the `y` dimension we:
- For `min`, we get the value that is one less than the current coordinate, or 0, if we go out of the grid.
- For `max`, we get the value that is two more than the current coordinate, or the length of the dimension, if we go out of the grid.  (Here, we want the _exclusive_ `max`.)

Finally, `grid[min_x:max_x, min_y:max_y]` uses slice notation to return the 3x3 grid of elements around the current coordinate. We use `np.sum()` to add up the values of these elements (remember that _on_ elements have a value of `1`, whilst _off_ elements have a value of `0`).  And finally, we need to remove the value of the coordinate at the centre itself, since this coordinate is not itself a neighbour.

Next, add a function that applies the rules to obtain the next state:

```python
def update_grid(grid):
    new_grid = grid.copy()
    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):
            count = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)
            if grid[x, y] == 1 and count not in [2, 3]:
                new_grid[x, y] = 0
            elif grid[x, y] == 0 and count == 3:
                new_grid[x, y] = 1
                
    return new_grid
```

Finally we're ready to perform 100 iterations:

```python
    # Part 1
    p1_grid = grid.copy()
    for _ in range(ITERATIONS):
        p1_grid = update_grid(p1_grid)

    print(f"Part 1: {np.sum(p1_grid)}")
```

### Part 2

**With the four corners stuck in the on state, how many lights are on after 100 steps?**

Here we only need a couple of trivial changes.  First, we need to identify the coordinates of the four corners, set the values of the corners to `1`, and pass these coordinates into the `update_grid()` function:

```python
    # Part 2
    corners = [(0, 0), 
               (0, grid.shape[1]-1), 
               (grid.shape[0]-1, 0), 
               (grid.shape[0]-1, grid.shape[1]-1)]
    for x, y in corners:
        grid[x, y] = 1
        
    for _ in range(ITERATIONS):
        grid = update_grid(grid, corners)
```

Then we need to modify the `update_grid()` function so that it optionally takes a list of coordinates that need to stay turned on:

```python
def update_grid(grid, fixed_lights = None):
    new_grid = grid.copy()
    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if fixed_lights:
                if (x, y) in fixed_lights:
                    continue
            count = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)
            if grid[x, y] == 1 and count not in [2, 3]:
                new_grid[x, y] = 0
            elif grid[x, y] == 0 and count == 3:
                new_grid[x, y] = 1
                
    return new_grid
```

You'll see that as we're looping through all the `x, y` coordinates, the loop skips to the next iteration of the inner loop, if the coordinate is one of the corners. I.e. if we're on a corner, then do nothing and move on to the next coordinate.

### Results

```text
Part 1: 821
Part 2: 886
Execution time: 5.2444 seconds
```

You can see that this solution runs considerably faster, is easier to read, and requires a lot less code.
