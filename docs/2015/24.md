## Problem Intro

We're told we need to load up the sleigh, by splitting all packages into three groups of equal weight. The three groups will be placed into three locations on the sleigh:

1. The _passenger_ compartment.
1. A container to the left of the  _passenger_ compartment.
1. A container to the right of the  _passenger_ compartment. 

To allow room for Santa's legs, the group of packages going in the passenger compartment needs to have as few packages as possible.  Furthermore, if there are multiple ways to arrange the groups such that the _passenger_ compartment has the fewest packages, then we need to select the configuration with the lowest _quantum entanglement_ of the _passenger_ group. _Quantum entanglement_ is defined as the products of weights in that group.

Our input is the sorted list of all package weights, e.g.

```text
1
2
3
4
5
7
8
9
10
11
```

## Part 1

**What is the quantum entanglement of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?**
