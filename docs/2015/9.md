## Problem Intro

// WiP

We're told that Santa needs to visit every location on his list exactly once.  The distances between all pairs of locations have been provided, in the form of data that looks like this:

```text
London to Dublin = 464
London to Belfast = 518
Dublin to Belfast = 141
```

## Part 1

**Starting at any location and ending at any location, what is the shortest distance that Santa must travel to visit every location exactly once?**

This is actually a fairly standard problem, known as the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem){:target="_blank"}.
