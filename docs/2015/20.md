## Problem Intro

An infinite number of elves have been tasked with delivering presents to an infinite number of houses, numbered sequentially as 1, 2, 3, etc. Each elf is numbered, and elves deliver to houses that are a multiple of their elf identifier. E.g.

- Elf #1 delivers to houses 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
- Elf #2 delivers to houses 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.
- Elf #3 delivers to houses 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.

When an elf visits a given house, it delivers ten times as many presents as its elf identifier. Thus:

<pre class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge highlight">
<grn>House</grn>   Elf 1   Elf 2   Elf 3   Elf 4   Elf 5   Elf 6   <ylw>Running Total</ylw>
<grn>1</grn>       10      -       -       -       -       -       <ylw>10</ylw>
<grn>2</grn>       10      20      -       -       -       -       <ylw>30</ylw>
<grn>3</grn>       10      -       30      -       -       -       <ylw>40</ylw>
<grn>4</grn>       10      20      -       40      -       -       <ylw>70</ylw>
<grn>5</grn>       10      -       -       -       50      -       <ylw>60</ylw>
<grn>6</grn>       10      20      30      -       -       60      <ylw>120</ylw>
</pre>

## Part 1

**What is the lowest house number of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in your puzzle input?**

What can we see 
```python
```

I'm using [regex](/python/regex) to parse the input lines for each group (nothing new here), and then - for the source groups - I'm using a [defaultdict](/python/defaultdict).  This is useful, because I want the `dict` key to be the source molecule, and the `dict` value to be a `list` of target molecules.  But I don't want to have to create the `list` for the first target molecule.

With the sample input above, this gives the following output:

## Part 2

TBC

## Results

If I set my logging level to `INFO` rather than `DEBUG`, and run with my real data, the output looks like this:

<img src="{{'/assets/images/2015-19-all-output.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Reindeer chemistry output" width="640px" />

So, it's pretty quick!
