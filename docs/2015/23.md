## Problem Intro

**_Thank God!_**

After the horrendous experience from [yesterday](/2015/23){:target="_blank"}, it was such a relief to have a simple task that didn't take... well, forever!

We're told we have a computer that has two regiters and understands six different instructions.  The registers are named `a` and `b` and can store non-negative integers. Both registers start with their value set to 0.

Our six instructions are as follows:

|Instruction|Action|
|-----------|------|
|hlf r      |Halves the value in register r, then on to next instruction.|
|tpl r      |Triples the value in register r, then on to next instruction.|
|inc r      |Increments the value of register r by 1, then on to next instruction.|
|jmp sn     |Continues with the instruction at location i +/- n, where i is the current instruction, <br>and s is either + or -.|
|jie r, sn  |"jump if even" - like jmp n, but only jumps if register r contains an even value.|
|jio r, sn  |"jump if odd" - like jmp n, but only jumps if register r contains an odd value.|

We're given a sample program that looks like this:

```text
inc a
jio a, +2
tpl a
inc a
```

## Part 1

**What is the value in register b when the program in your puzzle input is finished executing?**



## Part 2

## Results

It's not short. It's not even fast.
