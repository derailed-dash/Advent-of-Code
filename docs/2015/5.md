## Solution Intro

We're asked to parse a list of strings, and determine which ones are _naughty_, and which ones are _nice_.

_Nice_ strings must match the following rules:

- Contains at least three vowels. (They don't have to be different.)
- Contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, e.g. aa, bb, cc, etc.
- Does not contain any of ab, cd, pq, xy.

The input data looks something like this:

```text
ugknbfddgicrmopn
jchzalrnumimnmhp
haegwjzuvuyypxyu
dvszwmarrgswjxmb
```

## Part 1

**How many strings are nice?**

We could do this the naive way.  For example, for the first rule, we could iterate through all chars in the string `aeiou`, count how many times each appears in the line, and then add them to an overall vowel count.

But it's actually much more efficient (and fun!) to do this with **regex**.  And for me, this was a great opportunity to improve my [regex](/python/regex) skills.

Let's look at the regex for each rule:

### At least three vowels

```python
([aeiou].*){3,}
```

Breaking it down:

- `[aeiou]` means: match any one of `aeiou`
- `.*` means: followed by 0 or more characters
- wrapped in `(` and `)`, followed by `{3,}` means: match the whole thing three or more times.

### At least one character repeat

```python
(.)\1
```

- `(.)` defines a group, where the group matches any character
- `\1` means a _back-reference_ to the group before it.  I.e. determine what the group matched, and then repeat it.

### Does not contain ab, cd, pq, xy

```python
ab|cd|pq|xy
```

This is obvious.  It means any of `ab`, or `cd`, or `pq`, or `xy`.

### Solution

The code looks like this:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import time
import re

SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent 
INPUT_FILE = Path(SCRIPT_DIR, "input/input.txt")

# part 1 rules
three_vowels_match = re.compile(r"([aeiou].*){3,}") # Match any vowel, three or more times
double_chars_match = re.compile(r"(.)\1")  # \1 means: repeat what we matched before
bad_chars_match = re.compile(r"ab|cd|pq|xy")

def main():
    with open(INPUT_FILE, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read().splitlines()

    nice_lines_count = [part_1_rules_match(line) for line in data].count(True)
    print(f"Part 1: there are {nice_lines_count} nice strings.")

def part_1_rules_match(input_line):
    if (three_vowels_match.search(input_line) 
            and double_chars_match.search(input_line) 
            and not bad_chars_match.search(input_line)):
        return True
    
    return False
```

Note that I've created a function called `part_1_rules_match()`.  This function:

- Takes the current input line, and performs a regex `search()` using each of our three rules.
- The first two rules need to be `True`, whilst the last rule needs to be `False`.

Next, we use this function in a _list comprehension_.  I.e.

```python
[part_1_rules_match(line) for line in data]
```

- This code calls our function for each line in data, which is a `list` of `str`. It returns a `list` of boolean values.
- Finally, we count how many members of this list are `True`, using the `count()` method. Alternatively, we could have performed `sum()` over the list, since all `True` values have a integer value of `1` in Python.

Simples!

## Part 2

Santa has abandoned all the rules from Part 1!  A _nice_ string must now follow these rules:

- At least one adjacent pair of letters in the string must appear more than once, without overlapping. E.g. aabcdeaa.
- At least one pair of identical letters, with any single letter between them. E.g. aba, xyx, efe, and even zzz.

**How many strings are nice with the new rules?**

We need two new regex rules:

### A repeating pair

```python
(..).*\1
```

- The `(..)` identifies a group with any two adjacent characters.
- The `.*` means followed any character, 0 or more times.
- The `\1` is a _back-reference_, meaning, _repeat group 1_.  I.e. we must match the same two characters again.  

### Any two chars that repeat, with a single char between them

```python
(.).\1
```

- The `(.)` identifies any one character.
- The `.` after the group means that the group must be followed by exactly one character.
- The final `\1` means that the character in the first group (i.e. the first character matched) must now be repeated.

### Solution

First, let's add our regex rules:

```python
# part 2 rules
char_pair_repeats_match = re.compile(r"(..).*\1")
xwx_match = re.compile(r"(.).\1")
```

The remaining code additions to solve part 2 are trivial. First, a function that tests both of the new rules, and only returns `True` if both rules match:

```python
def part_2_rules_match(input_line):
    if (char_pair_repeats_match.search(input_line)
            and xwx_match.search(input_line)):
        return True
    
    return False
```

And finally, perform the count:

```python
    nice_lines_count = [part_2_rules_match(line) for line in data].count(True)
    print(f"Part 2: there are {nice_lines_count} nice strings.")
```

The final output looks something like this:

```text
Part 1: there are 258 nice strings.
Part 2: there are 53 nice strings.
Execution time: 0.0037 seconds
```
