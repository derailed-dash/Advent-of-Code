## Problem Intro

This one is quite a simple challenge. We have to read a sequence, and count how many digits there are in any group of the same digit.  We say this count aloud, and this forms the next iteration of the sequence.  E.g. 

- Iteration 1: 1 becomes 11 (1 copy of digit 1).
- Iteration 2: 11 becomes 21 (2 copies of digit 1).
- Iteration 3: 21 becomes 1211 (one 2 followed by one 1).
- Iteration 4: 1211 becomes 111221 (one 1, one 2, and two 1s).

And so on.

## Part 1

**How long is our resulting sequence after 40 iterations?**

Here's my function that does the hard work:

```python
def look_and_say(data: str) -> str:
    """ Perform a single look_and_say iteration

    Args:
        data (str): The input string, which is a seequence of numbers

    Returns:
        str: The resulting look-and-say string
    """
    digit_counts = []   # store each count as a (count, digit) tuple, e.g. [(3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 1)]
    digit_count = 0
    prev_digit = None
    for digit in data:
        if (prev_digit and digit != prev_digit):
            # if this digit is different to last digit, store the count of the last digit, and reset the count
            digit_counts.append([digit_count, prev_digit])
            digit_count = 0

        digit_count += 1
        prev_digit = digit

    digit_counts.append([digit_count, prev_digit])
    
    return "".join(str(count) + str(digit) for count, digit in digit_counts)
```

It's pretty simple.  It takes a sequence of numeric digits (as a `str`), and outputs the next sequence.

- It iterates through each digit in the sequence.
- If we've just read a digit that is different to the previous digit, then:
  - We've completed our preceding block of 1 or more identical digits. 
  - Store, in a tuple: `(count, digit)`
- If the current digit is the same as a the previous digit, increment our counter for this block of identical digits.

Finally, when we exit the loop, we use `"".join()` along with a list comprehension, to assemble our new digit sequence from all the `(count, digit)` pairs that we have in our list.

Finally, we want to run this function for the required number of iterations:

```python
ITERATIONS = 40

def main():
    input_file = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, INPUT_FILE)
    with open(input_file, mode="rt") as f:
        data = f.read()

    print(f"Input data: {data}")

    for _ in range(ITERATIONS):
        data = look_and_say(data)

    print(f"After {ITERATIONS} iterations, length of result is {len(data)}")
```

Easy!

## Part 2

**We're asked to now perform 50 iterations, and then determine the final output length.**

We don't need to change anything except the value of the `ITERATIONS` constant!

My output looks like this:

```text
Input data: 1321131112
After 50 iterations, length of result is 6989950
Execution time: 8.8330 seconds
```

So, it runs in just under 9 seconds.  We can probably do better, but this is good enough.
