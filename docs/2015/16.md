## Problem Intro

Apparently, we have received a present from one of our 500 aunts named "Sue".
We need to find out which one to thank.

The present she sent us as a _MFCSAM: My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine_. 
We use it to detect a bunch of attributes abotut the Sue we need to write to:

```text
children: 3
cats: 7
samoyeds: 2
pomeranians: 3
akitas: 0
vizslas: 0
goldfish: 5
trees: 3
cars: 2
perfumes: 1
```

You've created a list of attributes that you can remember about each Sue. If properties are missing from any given Sue, it means we simply can't remember that detail. The data looks something like this...

```text
Sue 1: cars: 9, akitas: 3, goldfish: 0
Sue 2: akitas: 9, children: 3, samoyeds: 9
Sue 3: trees: 6, cars: 6, children: 4
Sue 4: trees: 4, vizslas: 4, goldfish: 9
Sue 5: akitas: 9, vizslas: 7, cars: 5
Sue 6: vizslas: 6, goldfish: 6, akitas: 3
...

So, we know Sue 1 has 9 cars, 3 akitas, and 0 goldfish.  She might also have any number of trees; we just don't remember.
```

## Part 1

**What is the number of the Sue that got you the gift?**

Here's my strategy:

- Iterate through each key:value pair from the known attributes from the MFCSAM. 
  - For each:
    - If the key is present, and the value matches what the MFCSAM told us, 
      then this Sue is a candidate.
    - If the key is not present, then this Sue could also be a candidate.

And I hope that by the time I've processed the full list of MFCSAM attributes, there will only be one Sue left.

First, let's create a `dictionary` to contain all the attributes that we know about, from the MFCSAM:

```python
known_attribs = {
    'children': 3,
    'cats': 7,
    'samoyeds': 2,
    'pomeranians': 3,
    'akitas': 0,
    'vizslas': 0,
    'goldfish': 5,
    'trees': 3,
    'cars': 2,
    'perfumes': 1
}
```

Next, let's create a _dataclass_ so that we store all our instances of `Sue`:

```python
@dataclass
class Sue:
    """ A Sue has a unique number and a set of properties that look like...
    {'pomeranians': 3, 'perfumes': 1, 'vizslas': 0}
    """
    num: int
    properties: dict
```

Now we can process the input data:

```python
def process_input(data) -> list[Sue]:
    # Input looks like:
    # Sue 1: cars: 9, akitas: 3, goldfish: 0
    # Return list of Sue objects.
    sue_list = []

    for line in data:
        sue_num, attribs = line[4:].split(":", 1)
        properties = [x.strip().split(":") for x in attribs.split(",")]
        props_dict = {prop[0]: int(prop[1]) for prop in properties}
        sue_list.append(Sue(int(sue_num), props_dict))

    return sue_list
```

How does this work?

- We create an empty `list` to store all our `Sue` objects.
- We process each "Sue" line. Imagine we have this line: \
  `Sue 1: cars: 9, akitas: 3, goldfish: 0`
- We split the line at the first `:`, but ignoring the first four characters, i.e. ignoring `Sue `. This returns two values:
  - The _number_ of the Sue.
  - All the attributes, in a format that looks like this: \
    ` cars: 9, akitas: 3, goldfish: 0`
- We then have a [list comprehension](/python/comprehensions) whcih splits this line at the commas, and for each `property: count` returned, further splits at the `:`. So, with our example, we end up with this list: \
  `[['cars', ' 9'], ['akitas', ' 3'], ['goldfish', ' 0']]`
- We then turn this list into a `dictionary`, using a _dictionary comprehension_. So now we have this: \
  `{'cars': 9, 'akitas': 3, 'goldfish': 0}`
- Now we can create a `Sue` _object_ from the Sue _number_, and this `dict` of attributes.  
- And add the `Sue` object to our `list`.

If I look at the resulting Sue `list` in my IDE debugger, it looks like this:

<img src="{{'/assets/images/sue_list.png' | relative_url }}" style="width:480px" alt="Sue List" />  

Now we're ready to implement the strategy described above:

```python
    # we need to find any Sue where k:v is an exact match
    # but also consider any Sue where the k is not present as we don't know the v
    for known_attrib, known_attrib_value in known_attribs.items():
        sues_matching_attrib = [sue for sue in sue_candidates 
                                            if known_attrib in sue.properties
                                            and known_attrib_value == sue.properties[known_attrib]]
        sues_missing_attrib = [sue for sue in sue_candidates if known_attrib not in sue.properties]

        sue_candidates = sues_matching_attrib + sues_missing_attrib

    print(f"Part 1: Aunt Sue candidates matching MFCSAM attributes: {sue_candidates[0].num}")
```

How does it work?

- We iterate through our list of known properties and values from the MFCSAM.
  - We use [list comprehension](/python/comprehensions) to return a `list` of all the `Sue` objects, where the key and value match what the MFCSAM told us.
  - We use [list comprehension](/python/comprehensions) to return a `list` of all the `Sue` objects, where the key is not specified our the `Sue` objects.
  - We add these two lists together, to get our overall `list` of remaining candidates.
  - With each iteration, the candidate list gets shorter and shorter.

Eventually, there's only one left.

## Part 2

We're told that some of the readings from the MFCSAM are not accurate. Specifically:

- `cats` and `trees` values indicate that there are at **more** that many.
- `pomeranians` and `goldfish` values indicate that there are **fewer** than that many.

So we just need to modify our logic accordingly:

```python
    for known_attrib, known_attrib_value in known_attribs.items():
        sues_missing_attrib = [sue for sue in sue_candidates if known_attrib not in sue.properties]
        sues_matching_attrib = []

        if known_attrib in ['cats', 'trees']:
            sues_matching_attrib = [sue for sue in sue_candidates if known_attrib in sue.properties
                                        and known_attrib_value < sue.properties[known_attrib]]
        elif known_attrib in ['pomeranians', 'goldfish']:
            sues_matching_attrib = [sue for sue in sue_candidates if known_attrib in sue.properties
                                        and known_attrib_value > sue.properties[known_attrib]]
        else:
            sues_matching_attrib = [sue for sue in sue_candidates if known_attrib in sue.properties
                                        and known_attrib_value == sue.properties[known_attrib]]

        sue_candidates = sues_matching_attrib + sues_missing_attrib

    print(f"Part 2: Aunt Sue candidates matching MFCSAM attributes: {sue_candidates[0].num}")
```
