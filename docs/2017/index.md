Welcome to [AoC 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017){:target="_blank"}!

For this year, I decided to do something a bit different. Rather than creating my Python applications locally in [Visual Studio Code](/python/getting-started#development-environment--editor){:target="_blank"}, I decided to write my solutions in a [Jupyter Notebook](/python/jupyter-notebooks){:target="_blank"} instead! **This allows me to write the code, but also provide rich documentations and visuals, all in the same place.**

Furthermore, I've decided to create my Notebook in [Google Collaboratory, here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YrZhfXp6ZUnjua12-OeHrmPlxcbtCIxw#scrollTo=9Dgeww1rMrkQ){:target="_blank"}. Rationale:

- It's a pre-configured Jupyter Notebook environment, hosted by Google.
- It's free.
- It's easy to share it with all of you.
