Welcome to [AoC 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017){:target="_blank"}!

For this AoC event, I decided to do something a bit different. Up until now, I've been creating my AoC applications in [Visual Studio Code](/python/getting-started#development-environment--editor){:target="_blank"}, posting the code to my [Repo in GitHub](https://github.com/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code){:target="_blank"}, and then documenting my solutions in this site.  My approach to documenting has been to write my web pages using markdown, and then convert this markdown to a website using Jekyll, as described [here](https://medium.com/@derailed.dash/jekyll-container-image-a7785f9c5ed6){:target="_blank"}.

But wouldn't it be nice if I could write the code, write some pretty documentation, and capture the output, **all at the same time and and in the same place?**

Well of course you can!  **The answer is [Jupyter Notebooks](/python/jupyter-notebooks){:target="_blank"}!!**

You can check out my Advent of Code 2017 solution in these places:
- In [GitHub](https://github.com/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code/blob/master/src/AoC_2017/Dazbo's_Advent_of_Code_2017.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
- By running my notebook in the cloud for free, using [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code/blob/master/src/AoC_2017/Dazbo's_Advent_of_Code_2017.ipynb){:target="_blank"}.
