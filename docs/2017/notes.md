# Using Jupyter Notebook

## In Google Colab

### Overview

- Launch https://colab.research.google.com/
- Name the Notebook
- Save
  - The file is saved in Google Drive.
  - But you can also save a copy in to your GitHub repo.

### Challenges

- Colab doesn't natively support JupyterLab.
- Which means the development environment is not a swish and there's no GUI debugger.
- You can run JupyterLab from Colab, and then use soemthing like `ngrok` to expose it with a public URL.
  - But it still doesn't run a kernel that supports the visual debugger.

## In Anaconda Cloud
