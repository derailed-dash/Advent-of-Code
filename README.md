# Dazbo's Advent of Code

### See my walkthroughs [here](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/).

## Overview

- All AoC problems (covering multiple years) solved in Python.
- All solutions are thoroughly documented in the code.
- Some days have multiple solutions, i.e. to test different approaches, try different frameworks, etc.
- Each day gets its own folder. The name of the folder indicates some of the techniques and modules that were used.
- In addition, I have code walkthroughs and solution explanations available [here](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/).

## Purpose of this Repo

I've been using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as a way to improve my **Python** skills. Here I document my solutions across the various AoC years. My hope is that this guide will help others to:

- Become more proficient with Python.
- Solve AoC problems they might be stuck with.
- Learn some new libraries and inventive ways of doing things.

## Structure of this Repo

- The solution source code for AoC problems can be found in the `src` folder. This is _probably_ what you're here looking for.
- The source for the Walkthrough Website content is available in the `docs` folder. This is mostly markdown, rendered into an HTML static site using Jekyll.  You _probably_ wont be interested in this.
- If you want to look at the walkthrough pages, visit the [site](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/).

## What is Advent of Code?

An awesome [coding challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) created by Eric Wastl, released every December. A new problem is presented each day through the month. Typically the best way to solve any given problem is by writing a program. The program can be written in _any language and with any tools you like_. You don't need to be an expert coder to do AoC; in fact, AoC is a great way to learn a programming language.

Some problems are quite trivial and can be solved quickly; 
others can be a total PITA. Typically, the problems get harder as the month progresses.

You don't have to wait until December to try your hand at AoC though. 
All the previous events are available, and can be completed at _any_ time.

Each day is split into a Part 1 and a Part 2.  A star is awarded for each completed challenge.

**If you get 50 stars, you save Christmas!**
