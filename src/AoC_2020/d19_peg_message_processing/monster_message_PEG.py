Input is a block of rules followed by a block of messages.  E.g.
0: 4 1 5
1: 2 3 | 3 2
2: 4 4 | 5 5
3: 4 5 | 5 4
4: "a"
5: "b"

ababbb
bababa
abbbab
aaabbb
aaaabbb

Solution 2 of 2:
    Use PEG to perform depth-first recursion of rules.
    The PEG grammar contains all the rules necessary for recursive parsing.  No validation code required.

Part 2:
    Replace rules 8 and 11, resulting in self-referential loops in the rules, 
    which could result in infinite recursion.
    8: 42 | 42 8    - i.e. 42 can repeat
    11: 42 31 | 42 11 31  - i.e. can result in repeating (42 31), or (42 (42 31)+ 31)
