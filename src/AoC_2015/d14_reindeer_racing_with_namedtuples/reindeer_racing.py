Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/14

Various reindeer have speeds and rest times:
"Vixen can fly 8 km/s for 8 seconds, but then must rest for 53 seconds."

Solution:

Part 1:
    Compute distance travelled at time x.
    Determine the distance travelled by the reindeer that has gone furthest at t=2503.

Part 2:
    Each second, award a point to the reindeer currently in the lead.
    Use a defaultdict(int) to store the points.
    Determine which reindeer has the most points at t=2503.
