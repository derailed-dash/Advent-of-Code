Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/16

500 Sues. Each with different known attributes, and potentially other forgetten attributes.
Examine list of k:v pairs determined from item received from Sue,
using the My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM).

The MFCSAM produces properties, which we store as a dict.
We also have a list of k:v attributes that we can remember from 500 Sues. 
But where we don't know a value, the key is absent.

Solution:

Part 1:
    Iterate through our k:V from the MFCSAM. 
    For each Sue:
        If the k is not present, this Sue is a candidate.
        If k is present and the value matches, this Sue is a candidate.

Part 2: 
    Cats and trees readings indicates that there are greater than that many
    Pomeranians and goldfish readings indicate that there are fewer than that many
