Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/15

Cookie recipes contain exactly 100 spoonfulls of ingredients.
Each ingredient is made up of 5 properties: capacity, durability, flavour, texture, calories.
Each ingredient has a score for each of these properties.
Score of each property = qty1 * ingr1 + qt2 * ingr2... (or 0 if score is -ve)

Overall cookie score = product of all properties

Solution 1 of 2:
    Determine possible permutations by finding all combinations first (with replacement),
    and then expanding to permutations of those combinations.

Part 1:
    Get all permutations of quantities that sum to 100, 
    where the number of quantities is the number of ingredients.
    Note that Python permutations function is not suitable, as it doesn't allow for repeating quantities in our 100g.
    So, we can either use catesian product (slow @13s, because there are many results), or we can use
    combinations_with_replacement, and then expand these to the possible permutations of those combinations. (Much faster: 1.5s.)
    For each combo of ingredients, compute sum of quantities * prop.
    Cookie class to store combo, score, and calories.
    Determine score of best cookie.    

Part 2:
    Filter cookies list where calories == 500.
    Repeat approach to get cookie with highest score, from this new subset.
