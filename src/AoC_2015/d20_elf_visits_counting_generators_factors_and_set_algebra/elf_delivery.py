Infinite elves deliver to infinite houses numbered sequentially.
Each elf is assigned a number and a progression.
Elf e visits houses eh. E.g.
    elf 1 visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ...
    elf 2 visits    2     4     6     8    ...
    elf 3 visits       3        6        9 ...

At each house h, elf e delivers 10x presents.  Thus:
house 1 gets 10, house 2 gets 30, house 3 gets 40...

Solution:
    My approach seems inefficient.  It takes ~30s for both parts.

Part 1:
    E.g. for house 6, we must determine all factors of 6.  Why?
    Because the factors are the elves that will visit this house.
    Thus, house 6 is visted by elves 1, 2, 3, and 6.
    
    Use a generator to get factors for next house.
    Use a map to multiply each factor by the per_elf number.

Part 2:
    Elves now have a limit on the number of houses they visit. (50.)
    So, we need to count the occurences of each factor (i.e. each elf visit).
    When each elf reaches its limit of visits, add them to an exclude list.
    Use set difference to remove these from factors returned.
    (Having the exclude list as a set rather than a list is MUCH faster!)
