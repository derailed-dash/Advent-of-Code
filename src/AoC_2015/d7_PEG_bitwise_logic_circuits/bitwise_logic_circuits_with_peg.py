Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7

A value, a gate or a wire provide signals to a wire: 1-to-1.
Wires carry 16 bit (0-65535) signals.
Wires can provide a signal to multiple destinations: 1-to-many.

Instructions like:
123 -> x
456 -> y
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
x LSHIFT 2 -> f
y RSHIFT 2 -> g
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i

Solution 1 of 1:
    Use Parsimonious PEG to perform depth-first parsing of instructions.
    Instructions are out of order, so parse what we can, 
    and use a stack to park what we can't process until the next pass.
    For NOT gate, use ~ and then AND with all 1s, to ensure we don't return negative value.

Part 1:
    Just process the instructions, and return the value of wire a.

Part 2:
    Set wire b input signal to be the signal solution to Part 1.
    Solve for a new answer to wire a.
    Requires changing 19138 -> b to <value for a> -> b.
    Use regex to get the index of the only instruction that ends "-> b" and replace the instruction in the data.
    Then re-run the parse.
