Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/13

A lsit of people sat around the table.
Happiness scores depend on who sets next to whom. E.g.
    Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.

Solution:
    Use a defaultdict to store happiness scores each person.  E.g.
        happiness[Alice][Bob] = 54
    
    Use a set to store all people.
    Find all permutations of people around the table using itertools.permutations().
    Create a dict happiness_for_perms
    For each perm:
        We don't want to process reverse order of perms, so check using <= vs last element
        For each person around the table clockwise:
            Add up the happiness of the adjacent people
        Store happiness for this perm

Part 1:
    Find happiness of optimal seating arrangement

Part 2:
    Add myself, and assume that all happiness relationships are 0, wherever I go.
    
    Add myself to the dict for every other person in the set.
    Add me to the set.
    Repeat Part 1.
