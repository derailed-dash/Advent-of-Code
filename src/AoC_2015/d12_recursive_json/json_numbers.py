Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/12

Extract all numbers from JSON input.
The json data contains lists, dicts, numbers and strings.
These may be nested.

Solution:
    Recursively process the json.  
    Identify whether the current element is a dict, a list, a str or an int.
    If an int, just add it to the running total.
    If a str, ignore.
    If a dict, recursively call this method against all values for this dict.
    If a list, recurisvely call for all elements in this list.

Part 1:
    Sum of all integers stored anywhere in the json.

Part 2:
    Ignore any object (and all of its children) which has any property with the value "red".
    Ignore objects (dicts), but not lists.
    E.g. [1,{"c":"red","b":2},3] has the sum of 4, because the middle object (dict) is ignored.
    We do this by adding a second parameter to the process_json method, which takes a value to ignore.
    If this value is specified, and if its found in any values of the current dict, 
    then return 0 and do not recurse this dict.
