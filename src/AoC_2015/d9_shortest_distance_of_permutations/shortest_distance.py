Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9

Read a bunch of location pairs and distances between them.  E.g.
London to Dublin = 464

We must visit all the locations once and only once.

Solution:
    Use regex to create a [(location_1, location_2), distance] list for each distance.
    Use a set to store unique locations.
    Use itertools.permutations to obtain all possible location permutations.
    Iterate through each permutation, and determine distances between each location pair in that perm.
    Thus, we create a total distance for each perm.

Part 1:
    Minimum distance to visit all locations. I.e. min of all the total distances.

Part 2:
    Maximum distance to visit all locations. I.e. max of all the total distances.
