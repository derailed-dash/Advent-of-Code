Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/24

We require three bags of equal weight. 
   Bag 1 in the passenger compartment, needs to have fewest packages.
   Bags 2 and 3 to either side.
   
Solution:
   Use subset sum function to work out which combinations of packages adds up to 
   total weight / number of bags (compartments).
   The faster subsum is about 3x quicker than the version that uses itertools.combinations.
   Once we have all combinations for the first bag, sort by the number of packages, 
   since we want the first bag to have fewest possible packages.
   
   We don't care about what's in bags 2, 3...
   I.e. because we know we will have valid combinations of packages that will add up to the same weight
