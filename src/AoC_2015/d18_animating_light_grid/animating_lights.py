We have a grid of lights.  They can be on or off.
With each iteration, we update whether lights are on or off, according to these rules:
    - A light which is on stays on when 2 or 3 neighbors are on, and turns off otherwise.
    - A light which is off turns on if exactly 3 neighbors are on, and stays off otherwise.

Part 1:
    Use a set to store all lights as x, y tuples.
    Use another set to store only lights that are on.
    Iterate through all lights.  For each, obtain coords of all neighbours.
    Determine 'on' neighbours using intersection with the on_lights.
    Apply rules, now we know whether a light is on or off, and how many 'on' neighbours it has.

Part 2:
    As before, but treat corner lights as always on.
    Create a set that contains just the corners.  
    Union with this set at the beginning of every iteration.
    When processing each iteration, ignore rules for corners.
