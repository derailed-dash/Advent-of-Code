We can easily do this by [reading each line](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/reading_files), and calling the `split()` function, which automatically splits on the whitespace between the numbers. For each row, we now end up with two numbers, but returned as string values. So we use [map()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/map-filter-reduce) to turn the strings into integer types. Now we have a pair of integer numbers for each line, which we wrap in a tuple and return in a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions). I.e. one list containing tuples, which are each a pair of integers. Finally, we use the [zip()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/zip) function to turn the list of tuples pairs into a pair of lists: one list for left column, and one list for the right column.\n",

    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for a given update:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any page number N, there must NOT be a rule `B|N` for any `B` that comes AFTER it.\n",
    "- For any page number N, there must NOT be a rule `N|A` for any `A` that comes BEFORE it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rules appear to be a complete set, meaning that there wil be a rule for _every_ possible pair of pages. Or, to put it another way: if `A|B` and `B|C`, then there will always be a rule `A|C`. This rule will be provided; we do not have to derive it implicitly.\n",
    "- A given update does necessarily include every page and therefore does not need to include every rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- For some reason, I just felt like a class would be a neater way to manage our rules and updates, so I've gone with a `PageOrdering` class.\n",
    "- This includes a `_process_data()` method, which takes in the puzzle data and:\n",
    "  - Splits into two blocks - the first block for the rules and the second block for the updates.\n",
    "  - For the rules, I create `required_before` and `required_after` [defaultdicts](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/defaultdict), of type list.\n",
    "  - Every time we find a number on the left of the rule, we add the number on the right to the corresponding `required_after` list.\n",
    "  - Every time we find a number on the right of the rule, we add the number on the left to the corresponding `required_before` list.\n",
    "  - For the updates, I turn each line into a list of int values.\n",
    "- Next, the `_is_correctly_ordered(update)` method. This is the heart of the Part 1 solution. We:\n",
    "  - Iterate through each position for a given update.\n",
    "  - For a given position we build up a set of all the pages that were found before it, and all the pages found after it.\n",
    "  - Now get the set of all pages that are required before our page, and the set of all pages that are required after our page.\n",
    "  - Finally, we can just use the [set](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/sets) `intersect()` (shorthand of `&`) to determine if any of the pages found before are required after, and if any of the pages found after are required before. In either case, our update is NOT correctly ordered.\n",
    "- Then implement `get_updates_correctly_ordered()`, which loops through each update and checks it using the method above.\n",
    "- Finally, we'll create `sum_middles()` which takes a list of updates, and adds up the middle value from each one.\n",

    "Here I'm going to use my reusable `Grid` class because it already knows how to determine height and width, and how to check if a given location will be out of bounds of the grid.  I'm also using my reusable `Point` namedtuple, since this allows me to represent 2D coordinates using a more intuitive syntax like `point.x` rather than `point[0]`.\n",

    "I make a new `GuardMap` class by extending `Grid`. Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It contains class attributes that represent spaces, obstacles.\n",
    "- It contains a dictionary to map our four directors to vectors.\n",
    "- We have a `DIRECTIONS` string with our four directions. We can keep track of the index of our current direction, such that we simply increment this index whenever we want to turn right.\n",
    "- Start by iterating through all locations in the grid until we find a direction symbol, e.g. `^`. This is the location of our guard.\n",
    "- We store any locations we've visited in a dictionary that maps the location to the latest direction. We don't need this to solve the problem, but it does mean I can use this dictionary to visualise the path taken by our guard.\n",
    "- Now we provide a `move()` method that will be called repeatedly, until our guard exits the grid. In this method:\n",
    "  - Start a loop. And in this loop...\n",
    "  - Determine the next location by adding the current guard position to the vector corresponding to the current direction.\n",
    "  - If this next location takes us out-of-bounds, then we've exited the grid.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, get the value at this location. If it's a space, we just update our location and we're done.\n",
    "  - If it's an obstacle, then we need to rotate right by updating our direction index. And then continue the loop and try again.\n",
    "- Finally, to solve the problem, we just return the length of the dictionary that stores all the locations we've visited."

    "- First, convert the input data into a list of equations. Each equation will be a `tuple` of two parts: the required answer, and the tuple of all the integer numbers (parameters) of our equation.\n",
    "- For each tuple of numbers on the right of length `n`, there will be `n-1` operators to insert. E.g. with 3 numbers, we need every combination of 2 operators.\n",
    "- Let's use `itertools.product()` to determine the unique arrangements of `n-1` operators, given two operators. We use `product` because it allows us to repeat an operator. E.g. with `+` and `*` there will be four arrangements: `++`, `+*`, `*+`, and `**`. I'm doing this with a function called `get_op_perms()`.\n",
    "- I'm also caching this function. I can do this because the operators are always the same, so the arrangements are deterministic for any given required number of operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through each `equation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we get the arrangements of operators.\n",
    "- Then we loop through all arrangements of operators. Remember that each arrangement will be a tuple containing exactly the number of operators required between our numbers.\n",
    "- We apply the operator for each successive pair of numbers, always updating the \"left\" result such that it becomes the input to the next operation. I could do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    res = nums[0]  # Initialize with the first number\n",
    "    for i, op in enumerate(op_perm):\n",
    "        res = apply_op((res, nums[i + 1]), op)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a perfect use case for using the [reduce()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/map-filter-reduce#reduce) function (aka a \"fold\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    res = reduce(lambda acc, op_and_right: apply_op((acc, op_and_right[1]), op_and_right[0]),\n",
    "                 zip(op_perm, nums[1:]), # zip the operator with the next number\n",
    "                 nums[0])  # Start with the first number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reduce()` function works by applying the specified function successively to every pair of elements in our list. With each iteration, it stores the result in an \"aggregator\" and then uses this aggregator as the left-hand input to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda function itself defines a function with two parameters: the aggregator, and a tuple which contains the current `(operator, right-number)`. Note that we have to specify the initial value of the aggregator, which is the first number in our list.\n",

    "(Now I've done this, I think the first approach is more readable.  But oh well!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This bit is important: **We only require our equation to be valid once. So we should break the loop after adding the equation value to our total.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also created a function for applying the operator, called `apply_op()`. This makes use of the in-built `operator` module, which has a number of fuctions like `add()`, `mul()`, etc. This is useful because we can pick the appropriate function based on the `op` string, and pass our two numbers in as parameters to each of these functions."

    "\n",
    "This seems like a great opportunity to use [SymPy](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/solving-mathematical-problems-in-python-with-sympy-5f138c0deaef)!\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, for each claw machine we can represent the important data has three points: A, B, and prize. Let's create a `Claw` class to store these three points.\n",
    "- For processing the input data, I first split the input into blocks of 3 lines each. And for each line, I then use a bit of trivial [regex](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/regex) to extract the two numbers per line. I convert these number pairs to points, and then use these points to construct a `Claw` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the fun bit!! \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that we need `a` button presses and `b` button presses, to reach the prize point `p`. So we express this as two linear equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\cdot x_{a} + b \\cdot x_{b} = x_{p} \\\\\n",
    "a \\cdot y_{a} + b \\cdot y_{b} = y_{p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x_{a}$ is the x component of the `a` vector, $y_{a}$ is the y component of the `a` vector, and so on. This is saying, to reach the x location of point `p`, we need `a` presses + `b` presses.  And to reach the y location of point `p`, we need the same number `a` presses and `b` presses. So we must solve for where `a` and `b` are the same for these two equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "SymPy is great for this! I've created a `_solve()` method in the `Claw` class, which uses SymPy to solve for the two linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SymPy, I've named the variables like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ax = x_{a} \\\\\n",
    "bx = x_{b} \\\\\n",
    "px = x_{p} \\\\[1em]\n",
    "ay = y_{a} \\\\\n",
    "by = y_{b} \\\\\n",
    "py = y_{p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can just set up a pair of linear equations like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            sympy.Eq(a*ax + b*bx, px)\n",
    "            sympy.Eq(a*ay + b*by, py)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns a list of solutions, where each list contains a tuple of `(a_presses, b_presses)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I implement a `cost()` method, which determines the smallest `(a_presses * A_COST) + (b_presses * B_COST)` for all possible solutions. And that's it!\n"

    "- My `posn_at_t()` method simply returns a new point, which is the original position, plus `t` multiplied by the velocity vector.\n",
    "- The `move()` method updates the `_posn` attribute by adding the `velocity` vector once.\n",

    "Now to solve Part 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply our `posn_at_t()` method for each robot, with a time of 100s.\n",
    "- Store the resulting points as keys in a dictionary - created using a `defaultdict(int)` - which counts how many robots are at this particular point.\n",
    "- Establish the four quadrants in my `determine_quadrants()` function. This works by:\n",
    "  - Iterating over the top and bottom halves, and within: over the left and right halves. We can reference each quadrant with a tuple, i.e. `(0,0)` for top-left, `(1,0)` for top-right, `(0,1)` for bottom-left, and `(1,1)` for bottom right.\n",
    "  - For each position in each row in this quadrant, we count robots. This ultimately gives us the count of all robots in the quadrant.\n",
    "- Finally, we determine the product of the robot counts in each quadrant."

    "- Having executed the expansion, I need to reset the `Grid` variables, e.g. `_width`, `_height` and `_all_points`.\n",
    "- Then relocate the robot.\n",
    "- Now I create a new `do_next_instruction()` method. The key difference now is that we're not just pushing boxes in the same row or column. Instead, pushing a box could potentially push an ever-expanding triangle of boxes above it.\n",
    "  - Instead of doing an `while True` loop that exits when we find a space, we instead do a loop that continues for as long as there are boxes that can be pushed. If we hit a wall, then we can't push anything; and if we stop seeing boxes, then we're ready to push.\n",
    "  - So let's loop through locations, for as long as their are locations in the `to_move` list.\n",
    "  - After adding the robot location itself to `to_move`, we then look at the point immediately beyond the robot, in the required direction.\n",
    "  - As before, if the item in the next point is a box, we add this location to our `to_move` list. We're actually adding items to the same list we're currently interating over, which is perfectly valid in Python! So we keep going until there are no more boxes to add.\n",
    "  - In addition, if the location we just added was the left side of a box `[` then we also need to add the location to the right of it, `]`. Because we can't just push one side of a box! And similarly, if the item we just added was `]`, then we need to add the matching left half.\n",
    "  - We keep adding boxes until we hit a wall. If we hit a wall, we can't move.\n",
    "  - And now we must look beyond both of these locations, to see if there is a box one step removed. And if there is, we need to add extra left/right locations, as before.\n",
    "- Finally, we can do the move. Set our current position to a space, and move the robot into the next space. Then move our boxes by one place.\n"

    "We have a maze. Reindeer start on tile S facing east, and need to reach the end tile E.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Score increases by 1 for each step taken.\n",
    "- Score increases by 1000 for each 90 degree turn taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the lowest score a Reindeer could possibly get?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, since moves have cost, this seems like a perfect time to use [Dijkstra’s Algorithm](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/shortest_paths#dijkstras-algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "- Turns are far more costly than moves.\n",
    "- Back-tracking will never be valid, so we don't have to worry about this case.\n",
    "- The maze is bounded by walls, so we never have to check for out-of-bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `Maze` class that extends my `Grid` class.\n",
    "- Store our start and end positions.\n",
    "- Store a `DIRECTIONS` dictionary, to easily map current direction to a vector.\n",
    "- Store the move and turn costs as class attributes, for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the clever stuff happens in `find_lowest_cost_path()`. This is a standard Dijkstra implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a priority queue ([heapq](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/priority_queues)) to always process the state with the lowest cost first. For this reason, the cost must be the first item in any tuples we add to our priority queue.\n",
    "- Each state is represented as a tuple `(Point, direction)` where Point is the current position and direction is one of `^`, `>`, `v`, `<`.\n",
    "- `lowest_cost_for_state` stores the cost of reaching each state.\n",
    "- `came_from` keeps track of the \"breadcrumb trail,\" enabling us to reconstruct the path after finding the goal.\n",
    "- For each state, we consider three possible actions:\n",
    "  - Move forward (`M`): Move in the current direction at a cost of 1.\n",
    "  - Turn left (`L`) or right (`R`): Change direction at a cost of 1000.\n",
    "  - For each valid action, a new state (next_posn, next_dirn) is calculated.\n",
    "- Before enqueuing a state, the algorithm ensures that:\n",
    "  - The new state has not already been visited.\n",
    "  - Or, the new cost to reach this state is lower than a previously recorded cost.\n",
    "- Finally, if the current position matches the end, the algorithm terminates and returns the cost and the `came_from` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bit of fun, I also implemented a method that determines the path taken, by backtracking from our `came_from` dictionary, from end to start. And then I've used this to visualise maze and the path taken, using a `matplotlib` plot. Now I can draw a maze like this:\n",

    "We can run our program in reverse, to determine the required value of `a`. I'm working with `2,4,1,6,7,5,4,6,1,4,5,5,0,3,3,0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note about the program that are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our program starts with a value of `a`, and then performs a number of iterations. It generates an output with each iteration. And it only completes when `a` is 0.\n",
    "- Each iteration of the program (i.e. following the `jnz`) updates the value of `a` based on the previous value of `a`.\n",
    "- But the values of `b` and `c` are both dependent ONLY on the value of `a` in each cycle. And so, the current values of `b` and `c` at the beginning of each iteration are irrelevant. This is good, because it means we can always test our program by only changing a value of `a` and seeing what outputs are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So we can start the reverse process by setting register `a` to 0. \n",
    "- Then we need to determine which _previous_ values of `a` would _output_ `0`. Why `0`? Because this is the last output of our program.\n",
    "- The _last_ instruction in our program is **the only instruction that modifies `a`**. (All other instructions modify other registers.) So to get to the previous value of `a`, we only need to reverse this last instruction!\n",
    "- The last instrution is `a // 8`, which is equivalent to `a >> 3`. I.e. it strips the last 3 bits of our number. So to reverse it, we need to add 3 bits back in. Since `2**3 = 8`, this means there are 8 combinations of bits we need to add to our value of `a` to try. E.g. if `a == 0o0000`, then we can try each of `0o0000, 0o0001, 0o0010, 0o0011, 0o0100, 0o0101, 0o0110, 0o0111`.\n",
    "- So try each of these values by inserting it back at the top of our program, and testing if the _first digit_ of the output is the required digit. (Because each time we run the program, our output will grow by one.) If this is the required digit we add this value of `a` into a _new_ set of values to try, to get the _next_ output. Note that the number of values to try for a given output digit will never exceed 8.\n",
    "- Finally, when we've processed the last digit in our (reversed) program, we can simply return the minimum value of the current valid values for register `a`."
