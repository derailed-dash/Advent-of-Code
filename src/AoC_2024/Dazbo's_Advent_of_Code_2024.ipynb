    "1. Build two lists by splitting each line into two numbers. We can easily do this by [reading each line](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/reading_files), and calling the `split()` function, which automatically splits on the whitespace between the numbers. For each row, we now end up with two numbers, but returned as string values. So we use [map()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/map-filter-reduce) to turn the strings into integer types. Now we have a pair of integer numbers for each line, which we wrap in a tuple and return in a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions). I.e. one list containing tuples, which are each a pair of integers. Finally, we use the [zip()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/zip) function to turn the list of tuples pairs into a pair of lists: one list for left column, and one list for the right column.\n",
    "1. Sort the two lists, such that the smallest number in each column comes first, and so on.\n",
    "1. Find the absolute difference between each pair of numbers, and sum these differences."

    "- Create a dictinary to count how many times a given character is part of a matched word. Why did I do this?\n",
    "  - Firstly, we can use this dictionary to determine if any given character in the grid has been matched in a word. This makes it easy to print a grid that only shows matched characters. Useful for debugging!\n",
    "  - Secondly, I thought Part 2 might be asking where we have characters that are matched more than once, i.e. where words cross. This dict would have made it super easy for me to determine that. Alas, my guess was wrong!\n",
    "- Now move through each location in the grid, and stop whenever we find the `X` of `XMAS`.\n",
    "- Having identified the starting `X`, now iterate through all 8 possible directions.\n",
    "- For each direction, first determine if the full word can fit in the grid, i.e. that we don't get cut off by a grid edge.\n",
    "- If the word can fit, we then move one char at a time in the current direction, and test if the characters match the remaining characters in our word. \n",
    "- If all characters match, then we've matched the word and we can increment that `matches` counter.  But also, increment the counts for each character in this word.\n",
    "- Now, render a visualisation of the grid, showing a `.` whenever the count at this location is 0, else show the character at this location.#\n",
    "- Finally, return the total number of `matches`.\n"
