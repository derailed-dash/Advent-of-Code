    "1. Build two lists by splitting each line into two numbers. We can easily do this by [reading each line](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/reading_files), and calling the `split()` function, which automatically splits on the whitespace between the numbers. For each row, we now end up with two numbers, but returned as string values. So we use [map()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/map-filter-reduce) to turn the strings into integer types. Now we have a pair of integer numbers for each line, which we wrap in a tuple and return in a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions). I.e. one list containing tuples, which are each a pair of integers. Finally, we use the [zip()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/zip) function to turn the list of tuples pairs into a pair of lists: one list for left column, and one list for the right column.\n",
    "1. Sort the two lists, such that the smallest number in each column comes first, and so on.\n",
    "1. Find the absolute difference between each pair of numbers, and sum these differences."
