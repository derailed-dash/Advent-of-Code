We can easily do this by [reading each line](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/reading_files), and calling the `split()` function, which automatically splits on the whitespace between the numbers. For each row, we now end up with two numbers, but returned as string values. So we use [map()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/map-filter-reduce) to turn the strings into integer types. Now we have a pair of integer numbers for each line, which we wrap in a tuple and return in a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions). I.e. one list containing tuples, which are each a pair of integers. Finally, we use the [zip()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/zip) function to turn the list of tuples pairs into a pair of lists: one list for left column, and one list for the right column.\n",

    "- Move the X through every possible location in the grid. We'll start by matching the `A` at the centre of the grid. For this reason, we should start at position `(1, 1)`, we will we will always stop one row / column before any given edge.\n",
    "- Having matched an `A`, determine the coordinates of the four corners.\n",
    "- Check that the four corners contain each remaining character (i.e. `M` or `S`) twice. If so, this location is a candidate.\n",
    "- If we've found a candidate, determine the char in the top-right corner. Then determine if the char in the bottom-left corner is the _other_ end character in our word. If it is, then we've got a match. Why? Because if we've verified this diagonal, then by previously verifying the character counts, we know that the other diagonal is also satisfied.\n",

    "- The rules appear to be a complete set, meaning that there wil be a rule for _every_ possible pair of pages. Or, to put it another way: if `A|B` and `B|C`, then there will always be a rule `A|C`. This rule will be provided; we do not have to derive it implicitly.\n",
    "- A given update does necessarily include every page and therefore does not need to include every rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- For some reason, I just felt like a class would be a neater way to manage our rules and updates, so I've gone with a `PageOrdering` class.\n",
    "- This includes a `_process_data()` method, which takes in the puzzle data and:\n",
    "  - Splits into two blocks - the first block for the rules and the second block for the updates.\n",
    "  - For the rules, I create `required_before` and `required_after` [defaultdicts](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/defaultdict), of type list.\n",
    "  - Every time we find a number on the left of the rule, we add the number on the right to the corresponding `required_after` list.\n",
    "  - Every time we find a number on the right of the rule, we add the number on the left to the corresponding `required_before` list.\n",
    "  - For the updates, I turn each line into a list of int values.\n",
    "- Next, the `_is_correctly_ordered(update)` method. This is the heart of the Part 1 solution. We:\n",
    "  - Iterate through each position for a given update.\n",
    "  - For a given position we build up a set of all the pages that were found before it, and all the pages found after it.\n",
    "  - Now get the set of all pages that are required before our page, and the set of all pages that are required after our page.\n",
    "  - Finally, we can just use the [set](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/sets) `intersect()` (shorthand of `&`) to determine if any of the pages found before are required after, and if any of the pages found after are required before. In either case, our update is NOT correctly ordered.\n",
    "- Then implement `get_updates_correctly_ordered()`, which loops through each update and checks it using the method above.\n",
    "- Finally, we'll create `sum_middles()` which takes a list of updates, and adds up the middle value from each one.\n",

    "Here I'm going to use my reusable `Grid` class because it already knows how to determine height and width, and how to check if a given location will be out of bounds of the grid.  I'm also using my reusable `Point` namedtuple, since this allows me to represent 2D coordinates using a more intuitive syntax like `point.x` rather than `point[0]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- It contains class attributes that represent spaces, obstacles.\n",
    "- It contains a dictionary to map our four directors to vectors.\n",
    "- We have a `DIRECTIONS` string with our four directions. We can keep track of the index of our current direction, such that we simply increment this index whenever we want to turn right.\n",
    "- Start by iterating through all locations in the grid until we find a direction symbol, e.g. `^`. This is the location of our guard.\n",
    "- We store any locations we've visited in a dictionary that maps the location to the latest direction. We don't need this to solve the problem, but it does mean I can use this dictionary to visualise the path taken by our guard.\n",
    "- Now we provide a `move()` method that will be called repeatedly, until our guard exits the grid. In this method:\n",
    "  - Start a loop. And in this loop...\n",
    "  - Determine the next location by adding the current guard position to the vector corresponding to the current direction.\n",
    "  - If this next location takes us out-of-bounds, then we've exited the grid.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, get the value at this location. If it's a space, we just update our location and we're done.\n",
    "  - If it's an obstacle, then we need to rotate right by updating our direction index. And then continue the loop and try again.\n",
    "- Finally, to solve the problem, we just return the length of the dictionary that stores all the locations we've visited."

    "\n",
    "- Iterate through all locations in the original loop, as candidates for the obstacle. (Except the starting point.)\n",

    "- With each movement, check if we're in a loop. If so, exit this loop.\n",

    "- For each tuple of numbers on the right of length `n`, there will be `n-1` operators to insert. E.g. with 3 numbers, we need every combination of 2 operators.\n",
    "- Let's use `itertools.product()` to determine the unique arrangements of `n-1` operators, given two operators. We use `product` because it allows us to repeat an operator. E.g. with `+` and `*` there will be four arrangements: `++`, `+*`, `*+`, and `**`. I'm doing this with a function called `get_op_perms()`.\n",
    "- I'm also caching this function. I can do this because the operators are always the same, so the arrangements are deterministic for any given required number of operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through each `equation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we get the arrangements of operators.\n",
    "- Then we loop through all arrangements of operators. Remember that each arrangement will be a tuple containing exactly the number of operators required between our numbers.\n",
    "- We apply the operator for each successive pair of numbers, always updating the \"left\" result such that it becomes the input to the next operation. I could do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    res = nums[0]  # Initialize with the first number\n",
    "    for i, op in enumerate(op_perm):\n",
    "        res = apply_op((res, nums[i + 1]), op)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a perfect use case for using the [reduce()](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/map-filter-reduce#reduce) function (aka a \"fold\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    res = reduce(lambda acc, op_and_right: apply_op((acc, op_and_right[1]), op_and_right[0]),\n",
    "                 zip(op_perm, nums[1:]), # zip the operator with the next number\n",
    "                 nums[0])  # Start with the first number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reduce()` function works by applying the specified function successively to every pair of elements in our list. With each iteration, it stores the result in an \"aggregator\" and then uses this aggregator as the left-hand input to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda function itself defines a function with two parameters: the aggregator, and a tuple which contains the current `(operator, right-number)`. Note that we have to specify the initial value of the aggregator, which is the first number in our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Now I've done this, I think the first approach is more readable.  But oh well!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This bit is important: **We only require our equation to be valid once. So we should break the loop after adding the equation value to our total.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also created a function for applying the operator, called `apply_op()`. This makes use of the in-built `operator` module, which has a number of fuctions like `add()`, `mul()`, etc. This is useful because we can pick the appropriate function based on the `op` string, and pass our two numbers in as parameters to each of these functions."

    "- Take the popped block - which has the value of a file_id - and insert it into the first available space.\n",

    "\n",
    "- First, for each claw machine we can represent the important data has three points: A, B, and prize. Let's create a `Claw` class to store these three points.\n",
    "- For processing the input data, I first split the input into blocks of 3 lines each. And for each line, I then use a bit of trivial [regex](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/regex) to extract the two numbers per line. I convert these number pairs to points, and then use these points to construct a `Claw` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the fun bit!! \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that we need `a` button presses and `b` button presses, to reach the prize point `p`. So we express this as two linear equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\cdot x_{a} + b \\cdot x_{b} = x_{p} \\\\\n",
    "a \\cdot y_{a} + b \\cdot y_{b} = y_{p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x_{a}$ is the x component of the `a` vector, $y_{a}$ is the y component of the `a` vector, and so on. This is saying, to reach the x location of point `p`, we need `a` presses + `b` presses.  And to reach the y location of point `p`, we need the same number `a` presses and `b` presses. So we must solve for where `a` and `b` are the same for these two equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "SymPy is great for this! I've created a `_solve()` method in the `Claw` class, which uses SymPy to solve for the two linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SymPy, I've named the variables like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ax = x_{a} \\\\\n",
    "bx = x_{b} \\\\\n",
    "px = x_{p} \\\\[1em]\n",
    "ay = y_{a} \\\\\n",
    "by = y_{b} \\\\\n",
    "py = y_{p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can just set up a pair of linear equations like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            sympy.Eq(a*ax + b*bx, px)\n",
    "            sympy.Eq(a*ay + b*by, py)\n",

    "\n",

    "I love the way Eric is bringing all the previous storylines together here! The laternfish have built warehouse complexes to store their food! A robot in one such warehouse is misbehaving. We need to predict its movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a map of the warehouse, with a list of movements the robot will _attempt_ to make, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "########\n",
    "#..O.O.#\n",
    "##@.O..#\n",
    "#...O..#\n",
    "#.#.O..#\n",
    "#...O..#\n",
    "#......#\n",
    "########\n",
    "\n",
    "<^^>>>vv<v>>v<<\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The robot - @ - attempts to move, following the next instruction.\n",
    "- If it meets a box - O - it will attempt to the push the box out of the way.\n",
    "- But if the box is up against a wall - # - (or another box up against a wall), then nothing happens. Observe that there can be walls INSIDE the warehouse.\n",
    "- Similarly, if the robot is up against a wall, then nothing happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lanternfish GPS coordinate of a box is equal to 100 times its distance from the top edge of the map plus its distance from the left edge of the map. E.g. the box below is at `100 * 1 + 4 = 104`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "#######\n",
    "#...O..\n",
    "#......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the robot is finished moving, what is the sum of all boxes' GPS coordinates?**\n",

    "#### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse the input data.  Note that instructions block is composed of many lines. But we want to treat it like a single line. We can easily do this by using `replace()` to remove all the newline `\\n` characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `Warehouse` class that extends `Grid`. The class will:\n",
    "  - Determine the location of the robot and store this.\n",
    "  - Create an instruction generator that knows how to yield the `next_instruction()`.\n",
    "  - Create a class attribute that is a dictionary mapping the directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `do_next_instruction()` method, which:\n",
    "  - Fetches the next instructino and converts into into `delta` vector that adds 1 in the required direction.\n",
    "  - Establishes a list of locations that need to be moved by our `delta`. We add the robot location to this list.\n",
    "  - Then we look at the points beyond the robot, in the required direction.\n",
    "  - Iterate while `True`... When we reach a wall without finding any spaces, we return from the method.\n",
    "  - When we reach a box, we add to the list of locations that need to be moved, and then continue to next iteration.\n",
    "  - When we reach a space, then we know we can now move a segment of one or more contiguous boxes by  one, using the space. So break from the loop, as we're done adding items.\n",
    "  - Now we can move block of one or more boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  That's it!\n"

    "- Set up a dictinary with the above mappings, i.e. original value to the _doubled_ value.\n",
    "- Having executed the expansion, I need to reset the `Grid` variables, e.g. `_width`, `_height` and `_all_points`.\n",
    "- Then relocate the robot.\n",
    "- Now I create a new `do_next_instruction()` method. The key difference now is that we're not just pushing boxes in the same row or column. Instead, pushing a box could potentially push an ever-expanding triangle of boxes above it.\n",
    "  - Instead of doing an `while True` loop that exits when we find a space, we instead do a loop that continues for as long as there are boxes that can be pushed. If we hit a wall, then we can't push anything; and if we stop seeing boxes, then we're ready to push.\n",
    "  - So let's loop through locations, for as long as their are locations in the `to_move` list.\n",

    "  - As before, if the item in the next point is a box, we add this location to our `to_move` list. We're actually adding items to the same list we're currently interating over, which is perfectly valid in Python! So we keep going until there are no more boxes to add.\n",
    "  - In addition, if the location we just added was the left side of a box `[` then we also need to add the location to the right of it, `]`. Because we can't just push one side of a box! And similarly, if the item we just added was `]`, then we need to add the matching left half.\n",

    "  - And now we must look beyond both of these locations, to see if there is a box one step removed. And if there is, we need to add extra left/right locations, as before.\n",

    "- Turns are far more costly than moves.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Create a `Maze` class that extends my `Grid` class.\n",
    "- Store our start and end positions.\n",
    "- Store a `DIRECTIONS` dictionary, to easily map current direction to a vector.\n",
    "- Store the move and turn costs as class attributes, for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the clever stuff happens in `find_lowest_cost_path()`. This is a standard Dijkstra implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a priority queue ([heapq](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/priority_queues)) to always process the state with the lowest cost first. For this reason, the cost must be the first item in any tuples we add to our priority queue.\n",
    "- Each state is represented as a tuple `(Point, direction)` where Point is the current position and direction is one of `^`, `>`, `v`, `<`.\n",
    "- `lowest_cost_for_state` stores the cost of reaching each state.\n",
    "- `came_from` keeps track of the \"breadcrumb trail,\" enabling us to reconstruct the path after finding the goal.\n",
    "- For each state, we consider three possible actions:\n",
    "  - Move forward (`M`): Move in the current direction at a cost of 1.\n",
    "  - Turn left (`L`) or right (`R`): Change direction at a cost of 1000.\n",
    "  - For each valid action, a new state (next_posn, next_dirn) is calculated.\n",
    "- Before enqueuing a state, the algorithm ensures that:\n",
    "  - The new state has not already been visited.\n",
    "  - Or, the new cost to reach this state is lower than a previously recorded cost.\n",
    "- Finally, if the current position matches the end, the algorithm terminates and returns the cost and the `came_from` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bit of fun, I also implemented a method that determines the path taken, by backtracking from our `came_from` dictionary, from end to start. And then I've used this to visualise maze and the path taken, using a `matplotlib` plot. Now I can draw a maze like this:\n",

    "We can run our program in reverse, to determine the required value of `a`. I'm working with `2,4,1,6,7,5,4,6,1,4,5,5,0,3,3,0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note about the program that are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our program starts with a value of `a`, and then performs a number of iterations. It generates an output with each iteration. And it only completes when `a` is 0.\n",
    "- Each iteration of the program (i.e. following the `jnz`) updates the value of `a` based on the previous value of `a`.\n",
    "- But the values of `b` and `c` are both dependent ONLY on the value of `a` in each cycle. And so, the current values of `b` and `c` at the beginning of each iteration are irrelevant. This is good, because it means we can always test our program by only changing a value of `a` and seeing what outputs are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So we can start the reverse process by setting register `a` to 0. \n",
    "- Then we need to determine which _previous_ values of `a` would _output_ `0`. Why `0`? Because this is the last output of our program.\n",
    "- The _last_ instruction in our program is **the only instruction that modifies `a`**. (All other instructions modify other registers.) So to get to the previous value of `a`, we only need to reverse this last instruction!\n",
    "- The last instrution is `a // 8`, which is equivalent to `a >> 3`. I.e. it strips the last 3 bits of our number. So to reverse it, we need to add 3 bits back in. Since `2**3 = 8`, this means there are 8 combinations of bits we need to add to our value of `a` to try. E.g. if `a == 0o0000`, then we can try each of `0b0000, 0b0001, 0b0010, 0b0011, 0b0100, 0b0101, 0b0110, 0b0111`.\n",
    "- So try each of these values by inserting it back at the top of our program, and testing if the _first digit_ of the output is the required digit. (Because each time we run the program, our output will grow by one.) If this is the required digit we add this value of `a` into a _new_ set of values to try, to get the _next_ output. Note that the number of values to try for a given output digit will never exceed 8.\n",
    "- Finally, when we've processed the last digit in our (reversed) program, we can simply return the minimum value of the current valid values for register `a`."

    "#### Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, I feel depressed just reading this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think it through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each successive keypress on the _numeric_ keypad will require a combination of movement buttons on _direction remote 1_. We want the shortest combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are finite number of shortest-path ways for getting from any one position to any other position on the keypad. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "A -> 9: ^^^A\n",
    "A -> 2: ^<A, <^A\n",
    "A -> 8: ^^^<A, ^^<^A, ^<^^A, <^^^A\n",
    "2 -> 2: A\n",
    "2 -> 9: ^^>A, ^>^A, >^^A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work out the movements needed on our first directional keypad, we don't know which numeric keypad routes will require the fewest number of directional keypad presses. Consequently, we need to start with _all_ shortest paths for any given numeric keypad combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to get from these directions from the next remote we need the corresponding routes between each pair of keys in the directional remote. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "A -> >: vA\n",
    "A -> v: <vA, v<A\n",
    "A -> <: v<<A, <v<A\n",
    "A -> ^: <\n",
    "^ -> ^: A\n",
    "^ -> >: >vA, v>A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These mappings are repeatable onto the next remote, and the remote after that. So we can definitely cache these and reuse them between robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're given 029A as an example. Let's look at the process of pressing `9`, starting at `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "KEYPAD              START   KEYPRESSES\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Numberic keypad     (2)                               9 \n",
    "Direction remote 1  (A)           >           ^ ^     A \n",
    "Direction remote 2  (A)       v   A    <   ^  A A  >  A \n",
    "Direction remote 3  (A)     <vA >^A <v<A >^A >A A vA ^A \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- So we can map all `numeric keypad` pairs to `direction remote 1` presses. \n",
    "- And we can map all presses on `remote n` to presses on `remote n+1`.\n",
    "- All upstream mappings will end in an `A`, i.e. the button press on the remote that causes the button press on the downstream keypad.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I crreate a `KeyboardMapping` class. This class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has a static class attribute for directions (`^v<>`) mapped to point vectors.\n",
    "- Has a static class attribute for point vectors mapped to directions.\n",
    "- Instantiates based on an array that represents a keypad. We run `_build_keypad_dict()`, which goes through all rows and chars, and:\n",
    "  - Builds a dict that maps location (point) to key (e.g. `A`, `1`, `<`, etc)\n",
    "  - Builds a reverse dict that maps key to point.\n",
    "- Precomputes the path (in terms of directions `^v<>` and a final `A` press) that is required to move from any key to any other key on the keypad. It does this by running a BFS from every key to every other key.\n",
    "  - For each button pair, we create a path dictionary, with a key of `(start, end)` buttons, and a value of a list of upstream button presses.\n",
    "  - For each step along the way, we determine the direction from the valid vector point, and add it to the path list.\n",
    "  - Note that unlike a typical BFS that exits when we find the goal (i.e. the end button), in this case we want to store all paths that an equal shortest distance. We start by initialising a `best_path_len` to be a long number (I've gone with one longer than what is possible in the keypad). Everytime we reach the end, we determine if the new path is shorter. If it is, we update our `best_path_len`, and add in this path to `all_paths`. If we haven't reached the end, we add the next point / path to our BFS queue.\n",
    "  - Finally, for each pair, we convert the list of button presses to a string, and add our `A` button press.\n",
    "- The method `moves_for_sequence()` is able to take a sequence that is valid for the current keypad type (e.g. `029A` for a numeric keypad) and return the set of moves that repesent the shortest navigational keypad button presses that will result in this sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Numeric pad presses required:    0   ->  2      ->     9  -> A\n",
    "Nav 1 pad presses required         <^,^<   ^^>,^>^,>^^   vvv\n",
    "Paths                                2          3         1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need a cartesian product of these groups in order to obtain the possible complete sequences required."

    "We can use [NetworkX](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/networkx) for this. One handy method is `enumerate_all_cliques()`. This is used to find all _cliques_ in a graph. A clique is a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent. What this means is that there is an edge between every pair of nodes in the clique. To put it another way: every node in the subset is directly connected to every other node.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can use this to identify _triangles_, i.e. subsets of machines where every machine is connected to every other machine. We can do this by identifying all cliques with size of 3.

    "Instead, we need to understand what the input data is telling us. The input data contains many AND, OR and XOR instructions, where each instruction takes two input values and produces an output value. Many of these outputs are intermediate inputs to subsequent instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that these instructions are demonstrating a _ripple adder circuit_. A ripple carry adder is a series of 1-bit adders, where each adder:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes two 1 bit inputs (let's call them `x` and `y`) and a carry input (C<sub>in</sub>).\n",
    "- Generates a single _sum_ output.\n",
    "- Generates a single carry output (C<sub>out</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can think of an adder as taking 3 inputs and having two outputs. One output is the sum of binary digits for this _column_, and the other output is the carry-over digit, to be added to the next column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can add two 1-bit numbers as shown below. The initial input carry is 0. But, of course, 1+1 results in a 0 in binary, with 1 carried to the next column.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Carry         1     0\n",
    "Input x          1\n",
    "Input y     +    1\n",
    "            -------\n",
    "Result        1  0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A single adder can be depicted like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/1-bit-fa.png\" width=\"280px\" alt=\"Full Adder\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can implement a multi-bit ripple adder like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/ripple-adder.png\" width=\"480px\" alt=\"Ripple Adder\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is how we can generate a single 5-bit number from the addition of two 4-bit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we relate this to the problem? Well, to implement each adder in the ripple carry adder, we need to combine a number of gates. There are a couple of ways this can be done. So let's actually visualise what our instructions are doing, and then we'll know...\n",

    "But what about the _carry bit_? The _carry bit_ will be 1 only when both `x` and `y` are 1. And we can see this implemented in our instructions: for each pair `x` and `y`, we see that there is an `AND` gate, and this `AND` gate is **creating the _carry bit_.** The _carry bit_ (let's call it `c00`) is stored as an intermediate value which must be then added to the next pair of numbers - `x01` and `y01`. This is achieved by taking the `XOR` of the `x01`, `y01` and then the `XOR` of the result with the carry bit. This is how we get `z01`. \n",
    "\n",
    "But again, we need a carry bit. Unlike the previous case, the new carry bit is created by combining the previous carry bit (`c00`) with our two bits, `x01` and `y01`. So we have three inputs, rather than two. Here, we can set the new carry bit `c01` in one of two ways:\n",

    "- `(x01 ^ y01) & c01` - two values are true including carry bit - carry over required\n",
    "- `x01 & y01` - two values are true excluding carry bit - carry over required\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are some obvious issues. In my data, I can immediately see issues with `z06`, `z11` and `z31`. So these are going to be part of the answer.  But what else?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "z06 = bpp | ghf     # An OR, but it should be an XOR\n",
    "  bpp = x06 & y06\n",

    "BUT... We don't need to! If we use the second validation approach then we can simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run `process_output()` for a range of input values to simulate all possible initialisation values for `x` and `y`. This will return the first bit (wire) where the validation fails. This is where our first swap will be required.\n",
    "- Swap pairs of outputs.\n",
    "- Now run `process_output()` again. If the first failure happens at a higher bit position, then this swap is good and we should keep it.\n",
    "\n",
    "My implementation works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `get_lowest_failure()` function runs `validate_output(wire_num)` for a range of bit locations, starting with the previous lowest failure, and ending when the next failure is detected.\n",
    "- The `validate_output()` function constructs `x` and `y` wires from the supplied `wire_num`. I.e. for a given bit position, we try:\n",
    "  - `x` set to 0 and 1\n",
    "  - `y` set to 0 and 1\n",
    "  - The carry bit set to 0 and 1.\n",
    "  - Thus, we're testing 8 different permutations for each bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each permutation we run `process_output()` for the required `z` wire. Then we retrieve the `z` value and check that it is the addition of `x` and `y` wires, and that it has also handled the carry bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we simply try swapping every pair of outputs in our operations list. With each swap we:\n",
    "- Re-run `get_lowest_failure()` and see if the new lowest bit is further along than the previous. If so, this was a good swap. Keep the swap, and move on to the next pair. Otherwise, undo the swap.\n",
    "- Note that some swaps can result in a circuit that fails to produce `z` values. In this case, our `process_gates_dfs()` will recurse indefinitely. To handle this I've included a recursion depth check in `process_gates_dfs()`. If we exceed the `max_depth` then the function will throw a `RecursionError`. If this error is thrown then we also treat this as a failed swap.\n",
