Rocks are falling.  And they resemble tetris pieces! They always fall in this order:
-, +, backwards L, |, â– .

Chamber is 7 units wide.  Rocks start to fall from:
- left edge 2 units from left wall
- bottom edge 3 units above highest rock in the room, or the floor.

Input is horizontal movement of the falling objects,
as a result of jets of gasses from the sides.  E.g.
>>><<><>><<<>><>>><<<>>><<<><<<>><>><<>>

This pattern also repeats indefinitely.

Rocks are pushed 1 unit, then fall one unit. 
The rock comes to rest in the fall step AFTER it reaches its lowest point.
Then another rock starts to fall.

Part 1:

How many units tall will the tower of rocks be after 2022 rocks have stopped falling?

- Shape class:
  - Has a set of all the Points it occupies.
  - Factory methods to create each shape.
    Point coordinates are created with the appropriate starting position (offset).
  - Factory method to create a shape for a set of points (e.g. when we move a shape)
  - Is hashable, so we can store it in sets.

- Tower class:
  - Use itertools.cycle to infinitely iterate through the input jet pattern.
    We can always generate the next jet.
  - Use itertools.cycle to infinitely iterate through the shapes in order.
    We can always generate the next shape.
  - Stores all points for all at rest shapes (set).
  - Stores the current top of all the settled points.
  - Can determine origin for new shapes, using current top.
  - Simulates dropping a shape:
    - Creates the new shape at the appropriate origin.
    - Calls move with next jet.
    - Calls move with down. 
      If we can't move down, settles the shape by adding current shape to settled points.
  - To move a shape:
    - Check if we can move left, right or down based on bounds; return if we can't.
    - If bounds are okay, generate candidate points from current shape.
    - Check if candidate intersects with settled.  If so, we can't move there.
    - Otherwise, update current shape to be new shape from candidate points.

- Finally, call tower.drop_shape 2022 times.
    
Part 2:

How tall will the tower be after 1000000000000 rocks have stopped?

Part 1 achieves 1M drops / minute. So running Part 1 for this many drops would take 2 years!
We need a better solution. We need a repeating cycle. 

Look for a repeat of:
- Same dropped rock. (Enumerate the rocks.)
- Same index in the jets. (Enumerate the jet data.)
- Identical rock formation - lets build a str (which is hashable) from the last 20 rows.

We will store these three values in a cache, implemented as a dict:
  - Key = rock_index, jet_index, rock_formation.
  - Value = (current height, current shape count)
  
Implement check_cache() method:
  - Check if the current key is in the cache. 
  - If it is, return (True, height, last_height, shape count, last shape count)
  - if not, update the cache
  
- Modify drop_shape():
  - When our shape is settled, check the cache.
  - If we get a cache hit, update a property for repeats_found.
  - Store the two crucial values of our repeat cycle: height delta, and shape count delta.
  
- Add calculate_height(drops) method:
  - Determine how many drops are still required.
  - Determine how many repeat cycles we need, by dividing by the shape count delta.
    Also determine if there is a remainder, so we can manually drop the remaining shapes.
  - Determine the height increase, based on this number of repeats. Add this to current height.
  - Finally, return the calculated height, and the shape drop remainder.

- Back in main():
  - Drop shapes until we find our first repeat. Store the initial height at this point.
  - Call calculate_height to determine the calculated height after n drops.
  - Manually drop shapes for any remainder. Get the new height.
  - The final height = calculated height + new height - initial height.
