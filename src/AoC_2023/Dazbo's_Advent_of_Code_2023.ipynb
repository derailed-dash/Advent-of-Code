    "- To solve:\n",
    "  - First, get all the symbol locations. This is trivial.\n",
    "  - Get the value of this symbol, and store it alongside the location in a dictionary.\n",
    "  - Then, get all the neighbour locations for each symbol location.\n",
    "  - Check if this neighbour is part of a part number range we've already found.  If it is, then we don't need to check this neighbour; we already know it's part of a part number.\n",
    "  - If the neighbour is a valid location, check if it is a digit. If it is, then this location is _in_ a part number. If so, use the method `get_part_number_continugous_range()` to determine the full set of points that make up this part number. It works by taking this location on this line of the grid, and walking backwards and fowards, until the value found is no longer a digit. We return the full set of contiguous digits as a part number range.\n",
    "  - Add this to the [set](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/sets) of ranges for this symbol, i.e. in the `ranges_for_symbol` dict. Note, here I'm using a [defaultdict](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/defaultdict), such that I can initialise each entry with an empty `set`, and then add to the set whenever we find a range.\n",
    "  - Also, add all the points from this range to a `set` called `all_range_locations_for_symbol`. We use this when checking each neighbour, to see if this neighbour is already part of a range associated with this symbol.\n",
    "  - Also, determine the part number for this range, using our `get_part_number_for_range()` method. Store the result in a `dict` called `part_range_to_num`, where the key is the range `tuple` itself.\n",

    "  - `\\s*`: This matches zero or more whitespace characters. The `*` means zero or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "  - `((?:\\d+\\s*)+)`: This is a capturing group containing a non-capturing group. The non-capturing group `(?:\\d+\\s*)` matches one or more digits followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The outer capturing group with the `+` at the end repeats this pattern one or more times. This is how I capture ALL of the `winning` numbers.\n",
    "  - `(?: \\|\\s+)`: This is another non-capturing group. It matches a literal space, followed by a vertical bar `|`, followed by one or more whitespace characters.\n",
    "  - `((?:\\d+\\s*)+)`: The same as before. This is how I capture ALL of the `actual` numbers.\n",
    "- I use this regex to parse each line:\n",
    "  - This gives me the `id`, a string containing all the `winning` numbers, and a string containing all the `actual` numbers.\n",
    "  - I split the `winning` and `actual` numbers at the space, using `split()`. This gives me a list of string values. Then I convert the string values to `int` using `map()`, and finally convert each `list` to a `set`.\n",

    "_\"The values on the initial `seeds:` line come in pairs. Within each pair, the first value is the start of the range and the second value is the length of the range.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Uh oh, the values on the seeds line now describes ranges of seed numbers. In the real input, these numbers are huge. We're going to have way too many seeds to iterate over each seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of mapping a source seed to a target value, we need to map the entire interval. By the way... **I hate intervals.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I was struggling to get my head around this problem, so I created a sketch:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fertiliser range mappings](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/fertiliser.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with intervals that represent our seeds.\n",
    "- In each map, any given target range will always be the same length as the source range.\n",
    "- As we propagate our seed intervals through each map, the following rules will apply:\n",
    "  - If the interval sits outside a mapped range, the target interval will be the same.\n",
    "  - If the interval sits inside a mapped range, the target interval will be shifted by the appropriate delta.\n",
    "  - If the interval is both within and outside a mapped range, then we will need to split the interval. The part that is in the range will be moved by the appropriate delta.  That part that is out of the range will stay the same.\n",
    "  - An interval might span multiple ranges. In this scenario, the interval must be split accordingly which will create more intervals.\n",
    "  - Although it is possible to get intervals that are adjacent, a given source interval will never create overlapping intervals. Phew!\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can't map individual seed values, as there's just too many. Instead, we can map the intervals of seed values, and we only care about any boundaries. I.e. at the beginning and end of any mapping range, at the beginning and end of any seeds interval, and at any intersections.\n",
    "- I added a `map_intervals()` method to my `GardinerMap` class. The job of this method is to map the supplied intervals into a new set of intervals. It works like this:\n",
    "  - Take all the intervals supplied (which will initally be the seed intervals) as an input list.\n",
    "  - Then iterate through our mapping ranges, as we did before.\n",
    "  - For each range, determine the source start, source end, and destination start values, as we did before.\n",
    "  - Initialise `temp_intervals`. We use this to store intervals that we still need to map.\n",
    "  - Now, loop over each interval supplied as input. With each loop iteration, `pop` the current interval off the list.\n",
    "  - For each interval, determine the boundary conditions that make up the left, middle, and right parts of the interval, after intersecting with the current range. There may be no intersection, in which case only the `left` or `right` portion will be available.\n",
    "  - If we have a `left` or `right` portion, then these are not intersecting with the current range.  So add these to our `temp_intervals`, and we can test them with the next range.\n",
    "  - If we have a `mid` portion, then this portion is intersecting with the current range. If so, we need to _shift_ the range to obtain the new range, using exactly the same logic as we used for shifting individual values in Part 1. Note: once we've mapped an interval portion like this, that portion will not be mapped again by this GardinerMap.\n",
    "  - Now, at the end of the loop for this interval, continue to the next loop iteration, which will process the next interval with this range.\n",
    "  - Once we've processed all intervals for this range, re-populate `src_intervals` using the current intervals stored in `temp_intervals`. This allows us to test these intervals with the next range.\n",
    "  - Any intervals that are never mapped with a range will instead be passed on, as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in our `solve_part2()` method, we iterate over all the `GardinerMap` instances, just as we did with Part 1. But this time, we're passing in the seed intervals into the `map_intervals` method of the first `GardinerMap`. This returns a new list of intervals, which we pass into the next `GardinerMap`. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we've left with the intervals generated by the _humidity-to-location_ map. This is a list of tuples, with each tuple containin the start and end values for that interval. So it's a trival matter to get the `min` of all the `start` values.\n",

    "Brilliant. I love these stories!!\n",
    "\n",

    "**Find the rank of every hand in your set. What are the total winnings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we're being asked to sort the hands from weakest to strongest.  Weakest is ranking 1, second weakest is rank 2, etc. Then, we determine winnings by multiplying rank by bid amount for each hand, and then adding them together to get total winnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for determining hand strengh:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usual poker hand strengths, i.e.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  5-of-a-kind > 4-of-a-kind\n",
    "              > full-house\n",
    "              > 3-of-a-kind\n",
    "              > two pair\n",
    "              > one pair\n",
    "              > high card\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- But unlike normal poker, hand strength tie-breakers are achieved by comparing the successive card strengths of cards in the hand, starting from first to last.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `Hand` class:\n",
    "  - In this class, create a dict class attribute to store `card_scores`. I've assigned integer values so we can compare card strength.\n",
    "  - Create a dict class attribute to store `HAND_TYPE`. Again, I've assigned integer values so that we can compare hands.\n",
    "  - Initialise with a string that represents our five cards.\n",
    "  - I'm using the Python `collections.Counter` class to help me determine the `HAND_TYPE`. The `Counter` class counts members of any collection passed to it, including strings. It stores the counts as a dict, in the form `{character: count}`. Then we can use `most_common()` to convert this dict into an ordered list of tuples, ordered by count.\n",
    "  - From here, it's trivial to determine the hand type.  For example, if `most_common()` count is 5, then we have five-of-a-kind.  If it's 4, then we have four-of-a-kind, and so on. Once we've determined the hand type, store it in the `self._hand_type` instance variable.\n",
    "  - Lastly, I need to be able compare one `Hand` to another, according to the rules above. In Python, we can do this by implementing the `__lt__()` (_less than_) method. Here, my `__lt__()` works by first comparing the values of the hand types. If the two hands have the same type, it then compares the cards in each hand, from left to right. Note that I'm using the cool [zip](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/zip) function to combine the two hands into a single iterable of tuples. This is a cool way to compare _items from thing1_ to _items from thing2_, where the two _things_ are the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now I read the input. For each line, I create a new `Hand` instance, and bid integer. I store these two values as a tuple, and add it to a list of `hands_and_bids`.\n",
    "- Then I sort the hands.  This is easy to do with `sorted()`, because of the work we already did in the `Hand` class. But because I want to sort the tuples of `(hand, bid)`, not just the hands, I need to tell the `sorted()` function that it should sort based on the first item in each tuple. \n",
    "  - This is easily done with a [lambda function](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/functions#lambda-functions): \\\n",
    "  `hands_and_bids = sorted(hands_and_bids, key=lambda x: x[0])`\n",
    "  - The `key` needs to be a function. Here, that function is simply returning the first item in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once sorted, it's easy to loop through my hands from weakest to strongest, and multiply the rank by the bid amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Done!"

    "Now `J` is a Joker. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It has the lowest score of any card, but it acts a wildcard.\n",
    "- When determine hand type, `J` becomes whatever results in the strongest hand type.\n",
    "- But when breaking ties, `J` is always considered as `J`, with low value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- I tweaked my `Hand` class so that we can pass in an optional `joker` boolean attribute upon initialisation.\n",
    "- When `joker=True`:\n",
    "  - Update the value of `J` in our `card_scores`. Thus, our `__lt__()` will now work without modification.\n",
    "  - In `_determine_hand_type()` I've added an extra block that only runs if we're in _joker mode_. This block replaces any `J` in the hand with the card type that is most common. (If the card type that is most common is the `J` itself, then we instead identify the next most common card type.) We then recount the cards, and then perform the same logic as before to determine the hand type.\n",

    "- The time taken to reach `??Z` is different for different paths.\n",
    "- We need to determine the time at which all the `??Z` converge.\n",
    "- And here's a crucial observation! Whenever you get to `??Z` and then continue, the _next_ node is always the node that the original `??A` took you to. (I checked this in my actual input data.) This means that the time required to get from `??A` to `??Z` is the same as the time required to get from this `??Z` back to itself. I.e. **the cycle time is constant, for any given path.**\n",

    "\n",
    "I used to _really_ hate [recursion](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/recursion). But, having been forced to use it a bit in previous AoCs, I now simply _dislike_ recursion. I don't dislike the _idea_ of it. I dislike the fact that my tiny brain seems to struggle with exactly what needs to be returned for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhoo... This problem is just begging for recursion!  If we were only ever seeing first-order and second-order progressions, then we could use simple math to work out the _n_ th term. But it was my guess that the real input could go pretty deep. So we need to be able to keep recursing to the next set of differences, until the differences remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[NumPy](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/numpy)** for the win!! NumPy has built in capabilities to determine the differences between values in an array, and return these differences as a new array!  This saves me a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here's my approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, I parse the input data. I convert each line into a `list` of `int`. I.e. each list represents our _sequence_.\n",
    "- Then, for each _sequence_, I convert it to a one dimension NumPy ndarray and pass to my `recurse_diffs()` function. Note that I'm using a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions) to do all of this, for each _sequence_. As a result, my `solve()` function is short, neat, and _Pythonic_.\n",
    "- Now, my recursive function, `recurse_diffs()`:\n",
    "  - Here, I first use the NumPy method `diff()` to return all the differences between terms, as a new `ndarray`.\n",
    "  - Then I use `np.all(diffs == diffs[0])` to check if _all_ the values in this _diffs_ array are equal to the value of the first term in the array.  If so, then we've reached the point where the _diffs_ are constant.\n",
    "  - If not, then we recursively call this same function, but passing in the current set of _diffs_ as the new sequence.\n",
    "  - When we've reached the level of nesting where the diffs are constant, we add this diff to the current sequence of diffs, and use this to determine the next value in the diffs sequence.\n",
    "  - Then we bubble this same approach all the way back to the top. I.e. for each level of diffs, we obtain the next diff. And finally, at the very top, this gives us the next value in our sequence.\n"

    "  - Determines which pipes/connects are valid in those directions, using `pipes_for_direction`.\n",

    "**My solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by taking the `came_from` breadcrumbs dict from Part 1, and converting it into a complete path of Points that make up our loop.\n",
    "  - Using the dict from farthest point out to starting point, I build a path of one half of the loop. Remember, the dict maps each point to its predecessor; it only goes one way so we have to go from furthest, and move all the way back to the start.\n",
    "  - But I still need to determine the path through the other half of the loop. I do this by determining: the _neighbour_ of the point that is furthest out, that is also part of our overall loop, that is not in the `first_half` path that we've already created, and which is also a valid move from the point that is furthest out. This gives me the _other_ point that is connected to the furthest out point in our loop.  And from here, I can now build a path from this point back to the start.\n",
    "  - Then I join these two paths together, thus creating the closed loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I determine all the _regions_ (pockets) i.e. contiguous points of tiles. \n",
    "- These are pockets of tiles that are either _inside_ or _outside_.\n",
    "- Again, I do this with a BFS _floodfill_, for all points that are not part of the main loop. \n",
    "- We expand a given point until we've fully flood-filled its associated region. Of course, each time we flood fill from a point, we eliminate a bunch of points that we need to flood fill form.\n",
    "- Interesting observation: I pass my main loop to my `get_tile_regions()` function in the form of a `list[Point]`. During our flood fill, we have to check if we've reached a point in the loop. However, it took minutes when I used a list. If I converted by loop points to a `set`, it **runs in seconds**!  Which just goes to show how much more efficient Python is at checking whether something is a member of `set`, vs checking membership of a `list`.`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I return these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each region, I can now arbitrarily pick any point in that region and see if that point is enclosed by the main loop. In the end, I cheated a little, and made use of `matplotlib` `contains_points()` to determine which regions are contained by the loop. Where any region has any point that is contained by the loop, we can conclude that all the points that region are contained by the loop. So we can add all these points to the list of included points.\n",

    "- This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18fgddy/2023_day_10_part_2_using_a_rendering_algorithm_to/) from `tomi901` provides a **nice visual** to explain how to determine whether a point is in or out.\n",
    "- One more option: you can **scale-up the entire grid by 3**. Every square is replaced by a 3x3 group of squares. The result is that loops that were adjacent now have a channel between them. This allows you to always flood fill to the outside, which makes elimination of _external_ tiles much easier."

    "\n",
    "**For each row, count all of the different arrangements of operational and broken springs that meet the given criteria. What is the sum of those counts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find all substitutions for `?` that result in valid records.\n",
    "\n",
    "After parsing each row, I store the record in my `SpringRecord` [dataclass](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/classes#dataclass). The count of possible valid arrangements is calculated by the [recursive](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/recursion) `get_arrangements_count()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method systematicalThe damaged_groups tuple defines the required lengths of contiguous blocks of #.\n",
    "The current group index indicates which group (block of #) you are currently trying to complete.\n",
    "This index helps in determining whether the current arrangement is in line with the damaged_groups requirements. For example, if you are working on the second group, the function knows to compare the current length of contiguous # characters with the second element in damaged_groups.ly explores every possible combination of `.`. and `#` for each `?` in the record. It keeps track of the current state (current character index, current group index, and length of the current group) to ensure the arrangement adheres to the constraints of `damaged_groups`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works like this:\n",
    "- `char_idx` stores the current position in the record string. At each step, we decide what the character at this position could be (`#` or `.`).\n",
    "- The `damaged_groups` tuple defines the required lengths of contiguous blocks of `#`. The current group index (`curr_group_idx`) indicates which group (block of `#`) we are currently trying to complete.\n",
    "- `curr_group_len` keeps track of how many `#` characters have been consecutively placed in the current group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these three pieces of information provide a complete snapshot of our progress through the string at any given recursion level. We know exactly where we are in the string, which group we are trying to fill, and how much of that group we have filled so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base case**\n",
    "  - When `char_idx` equals the length of the record, it means we've reached the end of the record.\n",
    "  - If `curr_group_idx` equals the length of `damaged_groups` and `curr_group_len` is `0`, all groups have been completed correctly, and this arrangement is valid.\n",
    "  - If `curr_group_idx` is the last group and `curr_group_len` equals the length of this last group, this is also a valid arrangement.\n",
    "  - In all other cases, the arrangement is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursion**\n",
    "  - The function iterates over each character (using `char_idx`) in the record. For each character position, it considers both possible states (`.` and `#`).\n",
    "  - We check if the character at `char_idx` in the record is either the same as the state being considered, or a `?`. I.e. because if the current character in the record is a `.`, then `.` is the only valid `char` to try. If the current character in the record is a `#`, then `#` is the only valid `char` to try. If the current character in the record is a `?`, then we can try substituting either `.` or `#`. Thus, whenever we encoutner `?`, our recursion branches into two paths.\n",
    "  - If the considered state is `.`, then there are two cases: 1) `curr_group_len` is `0`, which means we are  not currently counting a group of `#`, so we can safely proceed to the next character. And 2) `curr_group_len` equals the length of the current group in `damaged_groups`, meaning we've completed a group and can proceed to the next group.\n",
    "  - If the considered state is `#`, then we're extending (or beginning) the current group. We increment `curr_group_len` and proceed to the next character.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Why store only these three state values, rather than the entire arrangement string?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Storing the entire arrangement string at each step of the recursion would significantly increase the solution space requirement. For a string of length `n`, there would potentially be 2**n different arrangements (each `?` can be either `#` or `.`), and each arrangement would need to be stored in memory. For larger strings, this just gets too big. (And would not work for Part 2, when we get to it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Instead, this approach stores just three integer values, which is sufficient to continue the recursion without storing the entire arrangement. It's important to understand that the state values (current character index, current group index, and length of the current group) do not represent a complete arrangement in themselves. Instead, they represent a _state_ within the process of building an arrangement. \n",

    "Now we have to replace each record string with a record string that is five copies of the original, separated by `?`. And similarly, we have to replace the damaged springs groups with a new list of groups, that is five copies of the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through each `SpringRecord` we created before, and replicate the two fields as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For the `damaged_groups`, we can simply multiply them by 5 to create the new tuple. Python is clever like that!\n",
    "  - For the `record` strings, we have to first convert each string to a `list` containing our string. Then we can multiply the list five times to result in a list with five members. Then we can use Python's `join()` method, to join the five string members together, putting `?` in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, we can run the same code as for Part 1, but with a couple of tweaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - I've added @cache to the `get_arrangements_count()` method.  This caches any results for any states that we have seen before. And this means that for every recursion, we will have cached all the states that led to this recursion. Because our state is minimal (there are far fewer combinations of [char position, group number, group length] than there are of [record combinations]), this means we can effectively cache each state with each recursed arrangement count.\n",
    "  - To make this work, I have to ensure that my _state_ is _hashable_. I.e. this means that all the parameters I pass to the `get_arrangements_count()` method must themselves be hashable. In my original Part 1, my `SpringRecord` class was not hashable, because my class was mutable. I fixed this by 1) changing my `damaged_groups` from a `list` to a `tuple`, and 2) by adding `(frozen=True)` to my `@dataclass` decorator. This is sufficient to make my `SpringRecord` hashable."

    "Well, I can't just scale up the above. That's too many cycles. I need to be a bit more clever!\n",

    "\n",
    "- Each cycle requires us to tilt N, W, S, E.\n",
    "  - We already know how to tilt north. So one way we can tilt west is to rotate our grid by 90 degrees clockwise - which results in the original west now pointing north - and then tilting north again. And from there, if we rotate 90 degrees clockwise again and tilt north, this is equivalent to performing a tilt south. Repeat again from E. Then rotate one more time to bring us back to facing north.\n",
    "  - [NumPy](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/numpy) already provides a convenient method to rotate our grid: `np.rot90(grid, -1)`. Note: `-1` means clockwise. If we omit this, then the grid would rotate counterclockwise.\n",
    "- As I mentioned before, it's my expectation that after a number of initial cycles, the cycles will settle into a repeating pattern, where we will see the same configuration over and over again, every n cycles. So I need to keep track of all the post-cycle grid configurations I've' seen so far, until the point we see a grid configuration we've seen before.\n",
    "  - I can do this by storing each grid configuration in a dictionary _cache_ (along with the current cycle number as the value).\n",
    "  - However, the grid itself is not hashable, so I can convert it into a `tuple` (which is immutable) before storing it in the dictionary.\n",
    "  - Then, every time I perform a cycle, I check whether the resulting grid configuration is in the _cache_. If I haven't seen it before, I add this configuration to the _cache_. If I have seen it before, then I've found my first repeat.\n",
    "  - Having found the repeat, I can determine how many cycles are required between each repeat of configuration. I store this as `repeat_len`.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Repeating configurations](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/repeating_configs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the blue circles represent the grid configuration at the end of each cycle, where we haven't yet seen a repeat.  But eventually, we find that the green-yellow-red circles repeat.  So here we have a repeat length of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to find the nth configuration (which could be 999, 1000000, 1000000000, or whatever), then we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine how many cycles are required to get to n from our current cycle position. I store this as `remaining_cycles`. In our example, our current cycle position is just after the second green, since the second green represents the first detection of a repeated config.\n",
    "- Divide `remaining_cycles` by the repeat length and obtain the remainder. This remainder gives us the number of cycles we need to execute from here, in order to create the configuration that will be the same as the configuration at n. I call this `additional_cycles`.\n",
    "- For example, `additional_cycles` were equal to 0, then it means that the nth grid would be a green. If it were equal to 1, then the nth grid would be a yellow. If it were 2, then it would be a red.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my real data, my logging output shows:\n",

    "Current iteration 131; last seen at 80; repeat_len=51\n",
    "additional_cycles=28\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in total, I've only had to perform the cycle `131+28` times!  Which is a lot fewer than `1000000000`!!\n",

    "**Footnote:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was looking at this problem, it was immediately apparent to me that repeating cycles were likely. But you may be thinking... _\"Why would you think that?  Why did this solution occur to you?\"_\n",

    "Well, I guess it's partly intuition around what is likely to happen.  But perhaps more significantly... I've done a few AoCs now. And this isn't the first time we've seen a repeating cycle problem. So I think it's fair to say that a bit of AoC experience will help you quickly make an educated guess about what you need to do.  And if you haven't done AoC before (or similar), then this conclusion is less likely to be obvious.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have a series of 256 boxes in a line.\n",
    "- The boxes have holes to allow light through, and contain _multiple lenses_ for focussing. \n",
    "- The lenses can be removed, moved and replaced.\n",
    "- We have a library of lenses to choose from. Lenses are organised by focal length, ranging from 1 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're given the _Holiday ASCII String Helper Manual Arrangement Procedure (HASHMAP)_, and we're told to apply the procedure to our initialisation sequence. (I.e. the same input data). This is how the boxes are loaded with the right lenses in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialisation sequence is a series of comma-separated values.  Each value represents a step or operation. For each operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `abc` (the chars before the `-` or `=`) -> the lens label for this operation.\n",
    "- `compute_hash(label)` -> the intended box number.\n",
    "- If followed by `-`: \n",
    "  - Go to the relevant box and remove the lens with that label, if present. \n",
    "  - Then move any remaining lenses as far forward as possible without changing their order, filling any space made by the removed lens.\n",
    "- Or, if followed by `=n`:\n",
    "  - Insert the lens with focal length `n`.\n",
    "  - If there is already a lens in the box with this label, replace it _in situ_.\n",
    "  - If there is not already a lens in the box with this label, add this lens behind any other lenses in the box, as far forward as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, we're asked to determine the focussing power of each box, where focussing power is the product of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One plus the box number of the lens in question.\n",
    "- The slot number of the lens within the box: 1 for the first lens, 2 for the second lens, and so on.\n",
    "- The focal length of the lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution answer is the sum of these powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- I start by defining a `Box` [dataclass](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/classes#dataclass). The `Box` has attributes for:\n",
    "  - `num`\n",
    "  - `lenses` - a Python `list` containing our lenses, in the required order. Each lens is stored as a `(label, focus length)` tuple.\n",
    "  - `lenses_set` - this is possibly not necessary. But I wanted to make it efficient to determine if a given lens is in the `Box` without iterating through the `lenses` list of tuples. So I've added this set to do this check efficiently, before actually retrieving any lenses from the list. This set contains only the lens labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `focussing_power` - this is a pretty simple function that just follows the rules we've been given.\n",
    "- `get_lens_location(label)` - iterates through the `lenses` list, and checks if the supplied label matches the first term of the current tuple. If it does, we've found this lense.\n",
    "- `pop_lens(label)` - checks if this label is in our set. If it is, then use `get_lens_location(label)` to retrieve the index where this lens is stored, then pop that tuple from the list.  Note, when you `pop()` from a list `list` in Python, the remaining items automatically move up.  E.g. if we started with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and we popped `3` (the item at index `2`), then the result would be `[1, 2, 4]`. Note: I also delete the label from our set.\n",
    "- `add_lens(label, f_length, location)` - this adds the lens to our `lenses` list, either at the end (if `location` is `None`) or at the specified location in the list. (And, of course, I need to add the lens label to our `lenses_set`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally created a small bug here, because I was checking location like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if location:\n",
    "        self.lenses.insert(location, lens)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        self.lenses.append(lens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "My intent is to only insert at the specified location, if `location` is not `None`. But here, Python will return `False` if `location` is `None` or `0`. But `0` is a valid location, of course! So, to fix it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if location is None:\n",
    "        self.lenses.insert(location, lens)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        self.lenses.append(lens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to complete the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create our 256 boxes, initialised with empty lists of lenses.\n",
    "- Parse each step.\n",
    "- Get the lens label from the step.\n",
    "- Get the box number by hashing the step before the operation symbol.\n",
    "- If the operation is `-`, then simply call `pop_lens()` on the box.\n",
    "- If the operation is `=`, then check if this label already exists in the box. If it does, retrieve the current location and pop the lens at that location. Then, call `add_lens()` with the location we obtained, or `None` for the location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can sum up all the box focussing powers by placing a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions#aggregating-comprehensions) inside the `sum` function."

    "\n",
    "So... We need to find a path from a start to a goal, where the cost varies depending on the path taken. As usual for a Dijkstra, we need to use a [priority queue](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/priority_queues). First, we need to define some way to represent the state of our journey through the map. I'll represent state in a tuple that stores `(cost, current position, direction, straight steps taken)`. It's important that `cost` comes first, because our priority queue pops the next state based on the lowest value of the first item in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep popping next states until we reach the goal. To determine valid next states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We create `set` to store states that we've already explored.\n",
    "- If we're in our initial position, we don't have a direction yet.  So we can try all adjacent squares, and with each, we set `straight steps` to 1.\n",
    "- If we're not on the first step, then our valid next moves are left, right, or straight on. We can't go backwards.\n",
    "  - We can move left relative to our current direction by adding the vector `Point(-dirn.y, dirn.x)`.\n",
    "  - We can move right relative to our current direction by adding the vector `Point(dirn.y, -dirn.x)`.\n",
    "  - We can only go straight if `straight steps` is less than `3`.\n",
    "- Now we've got our new position and new direction, we can determine the cost of the next move, and add that cost to our current cumulative cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we return the total cumulative cost, when we reach the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's basically all there is to it for the Dijkstra solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "I was interested to see what would happen if I changed to an A* implementation. I did this by creating a `heuristic` variable that stores the combination of `path cost` with the _Manhattan distance_ between start and goal. The idea here is that by using the heuristic, we will favour paths that take us towards the goal. But when I added this, the solution took about twice as long to compute. Oh well... It was worth a try! \n",

    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I've defined a recursive function called `count_ranges()`. It's purpose is to count the total number of distinct accepted part ratings. It works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It takes three parameters:\n",
    "  - A dictionary that maps _xmas_ categories to a each start range. The values are tuples representing the inclusive `(low, high)` values of each range. Initially, the ranges will be defined as 1-4000 for each category.\n",
    "  - The current workflow name, which could be `A` for _accepted_ and `R` for _rejected_.\n",
    "  - The dictionary of all the workflows, which we simply use for mapping workflow name to actual `Workflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our base case:\n",
    "  - Returns `0` if the workflow is `R`.\n",
    "  - If the next workflow is `A`, then all the current ranges are accepted. So take the product of all _xmas_ ranges and return it.  E.g. if each of _xmas_ had a range from 901-1000 inclusive, then we would be accepting `100*100*100*100` distinct combinations of ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we set `total` to 0, which accumulates the count of accepted combinations as we process the rules and recursively process workflows.\n",
    "- Now we iterate through each rule `(condition, next_flow)` in the current workflow. Recall that we should exit once a condition evaluates to True, and move on to the associated next workflow. Moving onto the next workflow is achieved by calling the function recursively, with the next workflow and updated ranges.\n",
    "  - If the current condition is a comparison involving an _xmas_ category (e.g. `a<1716`), then we split the condition into three parts: _left_, _operator_ (i.e. `<` or `>`), and _right_. The left part will always be a _category_, and the right part will always be an integer value.\n",
    "  - Then we get the current range for the category component. I.e. from the ranges that were passed to the function, and using the category that was retrieved from the condition.\n",
    "  - The operator and right value are then used to split the current range into two parts: a subrange where the condition holds true, and a subrange where the condition does not hold.\n",
    "  - For each subrange, if the true subrange is not empty, this means that this range has met the condition, and we need to pass the range to the next workflow.\n",
    "  - If the true subrange is empty, this means there are no values within the current range of the category that satisfy the condition. So we need to move on to check the next condition in the `Workflow`.\n",
    "  - If the false subrange is empty, then there are no values left that do not meet the condition. Since the condition of the current rule encompasses all possible values in the range, there's no need to evaluate subsequent rules in the current workflow. Thus, we break from the loop. The function can safely proceed to process the true subrange (if not empty) in the next workflow or finalize the count if the decision is \"Accepted\" or \"Rejected\".\n",
    "- The final rule is always `True` and acts as the fallback condition for the `Workflow`. This condition will make a recursive call to the next workflow. \n",

    "Starting from the garden plot marked S on your map, how many garden plots could the Elf reach in exactly 64 steps?\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- I read in the data and convert to a 2D grid, where each row contains elements, and each element contains a single character.\n",
    "- Then I read through the grid, to find the `S` and mark its location as tuple of `(x, y)`.\n",
    "- Now I can do a [BFS](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/shortest_paths) to flood-fill the available locations we can move to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I decided to store `(location, steps taken)` in my seen state, since there are multiple ways to arrive at the same location. But I wanted to allow for backtracking, because we're allowed to go back to locations we've been to before. However, I then realised that I can simply store every location previously visited. _Why is this true?_ It is true because:\n",
    "  - If we arrive at any location and we have an _even_ number of steps remaining, then we can _always_ get back to this location on our last step. So if this condition is met, this location is a valid final location.\n",
    "  - If we arrive at any location and we have an _odd_ number of steps remaining, then there's no way to get back to this location on our last step. That's because for every _n_ steps we move away from our current location, we need to move _n_ steps back for this location to one of solution locations.  But _2n_ will _always_ be an even number. There's no way to travel _2n_ squares with an odd number of steps remaining.\n",
    "  - So to conclude: any location we visit will either be a valid solution location, or impossible to reach on our last step. In either case, we can mark it as seen and never revisit.\n",
    "\n",
    "My implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The queue itself is a `deque`, since this is an efficient structure in Python for implementing a queue with frequent appending and popping.\n",
    "- I retrieve the height of the grid, and assert it is also the width.\n",
    "- I add my starting location `(0, 0)` to the queue.\n",
    "- Then I iterate until the queue is empty:\n",
    "  - I pop from the queue, to retrieve the current location and remaining steps.\n",
    "  - As noted above, if we have an even number of steps remaining, then the current location is a valid end state, so store in our `answer` set.\n",
    "  - If we have any steps remaining, we now decrement the number of available steps by 1. Then we identify all the valid neighbours (within the grid). For any valid neighbour that isn't a rock (`#`), we can add it to the queue.\n",
    "  - When we've used up all the available steps, we will stop adding neighbours to the queue, so the queue will eventually be empty.\n",

    "- Consequently, the number of steps to get from the centre to the edge is 65.\n",
    "- We're asked to determine all positions reachable with 26501365 steps.\n",
    "  - Note that `26501365 // 131 == 202300`. I.e. this is the number of tile lengths that we can move away from the centre in a straight line, given this number of steps. It can't be coincidence that this puzzle is from AoC 2023!!\n",
    "  - Also, `26501365 % 131 == 65`.  So, we can move exactly 202300 and one half complete tile distances from the centre.\n",
    "- Comparing to the green diamonds above:\n",
    "  - `65` steps would take us to the edge of the first diamond.\n",
    "  - `65 + 131` steps would take us to the edge of the second diamond.\n",
    "  - `65 + (2*131)` steps would take us to the edge of the third diamond.\n",
    "\n",
    "_If we ignored the blocked squares_ (i.e. the rocks), then we could easily calculate the total number of positions reachable for a given number of steps: it would be the area of our diamond (which is a square) divided by 2, since we know that we can't we can't reach even squares with an odd number of steps available. I.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{(2n + 1)^2}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $p$ is the number of reachable plots, and $n$ is the number of steps. Since $n$ is how many steps we can take in any direction, the total width of our square is the sum $n$ in opposite directions (e.g. right + left), plus the square we start in. Hence $(2n + 1)$. Once we have the length of a side, we simply square this number to get the area of our square.\n",
    "\n",

    "Alas, we can't just use the formula above, because we can't ignore the configuration of our tiles. I.e. we can't ignore all the rocks!! Eliminating certain locations (i.e. the rocks)  cannot introduce higher-order terms to our equsetion, so the most general form will be a standard quadratic, i.e.\n",

    "\n",
    "We also know that we can't simply BFS for 26501365 steps, because that will never complete and our computer will blow up.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there is a cool way to determine the coefficients of a quadratic formula, if you have three points from a quadratic plot to work with. And we can get three such points!! The technique is called the _Three Point Formula_ and it is described at these links:\n",

    "#### BFS to Get Quadratic Coefficients Using Three Point Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do a BFS with this number of steps.  But first, we need to modify our BFS to allow us to expand beyond a single tile.  I.e. such that we can cross from one tile to an adjacent tile. The BFS can be modified to allow this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of storing start position and steps available in our FIFO queue, now we store: tile coordinate, position in tile, and steps remaining.  The first tile would have a tile coordinate of `(0,0)`. So the tile to the right would be `(1,0)`, the tile below would be `(0,1)`, and so on.\n",
    "- When we retrieve the neighbours of the current point, if the neighbour's coordinates fall outside of the grid boundary, then we update the tile coordinate, _and_ then offset the current coordinate _within_ the tile. For example, if we move off the current tile to the tile on the left, then the `x` coordinate _within_ the tile will now be `-1` and outside of the grid boundaryies. So we add the tile width to this `x` coordinate such that the x coordinate is `width-1`, which is a valid coordinate within the grid boundaries.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Figure how the blocks will settle based on the snapshot. Once they've settled, consider disintegrating a single brick; how many bricks could be safely chosen as the one to get disintegrated?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the configuration of the bricks once they've settled.\n",
    "- Determine which bricks then support other bricks.\n",
    "- We can disintegrate any bricks that are not the sole support of another brick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I create `Brick` class, to store the state of each brick. As a minimum, our brick needs `(x,y,z)` tuples that represent the two opposite coordinates.\n",
    "- I parse the input data, and convert each row into a `Brick`. This is easy enough, since we just split at the `~` to get the two sets of coordinates that we will use for our pair of tuples.\n",
    "- Next, I add `min_for_axis()` and `max_for_axis()` methods to my `Brick` class. These methods determine the minimum and maximum values for the axis specified, where `0 = x`, `1 = y`, `2 = z`.\n",
    "- We can go through each `Brick` and determine the minima and maxima for `x` and `y`, which gives us the overall `x,y` area that all our bricks fall within.  Think of this as representing the overall horizontal and vertical widths of our Jenga tower.\n",
    "- Next, I want to create a 2D grid for this area, that stores the maximum height (`z` value) that has been achieved in our stack so far. I do this by creating a [NumPy](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/numpy) grid called `height_map` with the required dimensions, and initialising all values to `0` initially.  I.e. the flat surface that we start with.\n",
    "- Now the fun part... It's time to drop the bricks!! A brick falls down through the air, but the coordinates it occupies in the `x,y` plane remains constant. Think of it as a falling down a rectangular groove.\n",
    "  - First... It's crucial to _sort_ them in ascending `z` order! This is because we want to be able to drop a brick and check for bricks below it. And we want to assume that the bricks are settling in `z` order, i.e. that no bricks that come _later_ in the input can contain bricks that are of lower height than our current brick. In the sample data, they are already sorted this way. But in the real data, this isn't the case.  (This delayed me getting the right answer for a while!!)\n",
    "  - So I've added a `__lt__()` method to my `Brick` class, which allows me to sort on the `z` value.  In Python, implementing `__lt__()` in your class is typically sufficient to allow sorting of classes using standard sort functions.\n",
    "  - Next, I want to determine the _xy area_ occupied by my current brick. So I've implemented an `xy_area()` method. This simply returns the two opposite coordinates of the xy rectangle.\n",
    "  - Then, I determine what is the current highest point (`z` value) of my `height_map`, for the section of section of the grid that corresponds to my brick's `xy_area`. This is because the section might contain any number of existing bricks. And one might be taller than others.  But we only care about the tallest point in the section.  Our new brick will end up sitting _on top_ of the tallest point.\n",
    "  - I then update my brick's lowest `z` value to be equal to this previous highest point, plus `1`.\n",
    "  - Next, I need to update the `height_map` such that the entire `xy_area` section has a height value that is equal to the prevous maximum height, plus the height of our `Brick`. So now, our `height_map` is up to date and includes the new `Brick`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for settling the brick into place.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that remains is to determine which existing bricks (which I call _base bricks_) our new brick sits on.  I do this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding our newly laid `Brick` into a dictionary that contains a set of all bricks at a given `z` level.\n",
    "- Then, for our newly laid `Brick`, I determine if my brick's `xy_area` intersects with any of the bricks in the set for the `z` level we've just landed on top of.  To perform the intersection check, I've added a method to my `Brick` called `area_intersects()`.  It works by:\n",
    "  - Checking if the right edge of either brick is to the left of the left edge of the other brick. If so, these don't intersect.\n",
    "  - And then doing the same check with the y axis.\n",
    "- If there is an intersection, then this new brick is sitting on top of one or more base bricks. I add these base bricks to a `brick_to_base_bricks` dictionary, which maps this current `Brick` to a set of `Base` bricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So we can build a `Brick` class that knows how to determine its own `x,y` space, and can also check for the intersection with another brick's `x,y` space. If the two bricks intersect for any given value of `z` then the falling brick can not descend to this `z` level, since it would hit another brick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to solve for Part 1, we just want to get all the _base_ bricks, where they are the one and only member of a `brick_to_base_bricks` set. Where this is true, this base brick is alone, and there are no other bricks supporting this particular brick. I've labelled these as `critical_base_bricks`. We just subtract this number from the total number of bricks, in order to get the bricks that can safely be disintegrated.\n"
