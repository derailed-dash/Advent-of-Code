    "  - Check if this neighbour is part of a part number range we've already found.  If it is, then we don't need to check this neighbour; we already know it's part of a part number.\n",

If so, use the method `get_part_number_continugous_range()` to determine the full set of points that make up this part number.

    "  - Has a `score()` method which determines the score, according to the rules.\n",

    "  `Card(?:\\s+)(\\d+):\\s*((?:\\d+\\s*)+)(?: \\|\\s+)((?:\\d+\\s*)+)` works:\n",
    "  - `(\\d+)`: This is a capturing group that matches one or more digits. The `\\d` is a shorthand character class that matches any digit (0-9), and the `+` means one or more of the preceding element. This is how I capture the `id`.\n",
    "  - `\\s*`: This matches zero or more whitespace characters. The `*` means zero or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "  - `((?:\\d+\\s*)+)`: This is a capturing group containing a non-capturing group. The non-capturing group `(?:\\d+\\s*)` matches one or more digits followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The outer capturing group with the `+` at the end repeats this pattern one or more times. This is how I capture ALL of the `winning` numbers.\n",
    "  - `(?: \\|\\s+)`: This is another non-capturing group. It matches a literal space, followed by a vertical bar `|`, followed by one or more whitespace characters.\n",
    "  - `((?:\\d+\\s*)+)`: The same as before. This is how I capture ALL of the `actual` numbers.\n",
    "- I use this regex to parse each line:\n",
    "  - This gives me the `id`, a string containing all the `winning` numbers, and a string containing all the `actual` numbers.\n",
    "  - I split the `winning` and `actual` numbers at the space, using `split()`. This gives me a list of string values. Then I convert the string values to `int` using `map()`, and finally convert each `list` to a `set`.\n",
    "  - Now I can create an instance of `ScoreCard` from the `id` and the two sets.\n",

If it is, we apply the required _shift_, which is the difference between the destination range start and the source range start. Now we've finished mapping, so we return the mapped value.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Fertiliser range mappings](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/fertiliser.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with intervals that represent our seeds.\n",
    "- In each map, any given target range will always be the same length as the source range.\n",
    "- As we propagate our seed intervals through each map, the following rules will apply:\n",
    "  - If the interval sits outside a mapped range, the target interval will be the same.\n",
    "  - If the interval sits inside a mapped range, the target interval will be shifted by the appropriate delta.\n",
    "  - If the interval is both within and outside a mapped range, then we will need to split the interval. The part that is in the range will be moved by the appropriate delta.  That part that is out of the range will stay the same.\n",
    "  - An interval might span multiple ranges. In this scenario, the interval must be split accordingly which will create more intervals.\n",
    "  - Although it is possible to get intervals that are adjacent, a given source interval will never create overlapping intervals. Phew!\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can't map individual seed values, as there's just too many. Instead, we can map the intervals of seed values, and we only care about any boundaries. I.e. at the beginning and end of any mapping range, at the beginning and end of any seeds interval, and at any intersections.\n",
    "- I added a `map_intervals()` method to my `GardinerMap` class. The job of this method is to map the supplied intervals into a new set of intervals. It works like this:\n",
    "  - Take all the intervals supplied (which will initally be the seed intervals) as an input list.\n",
    "  - Then iterate through our mapping ranges, as we did before.\n",
    "  - For each range, determine the source start, source end, and destination start values, as we did before.\n",
    "  - Initialise `temp_intervals`. We use this to store intervals that we still need to map.\n",
    "  - Now, loop over each interval supplied as input. With each loop iteration, `pop` the current interval off the list.\n",
    "  - For each interval, determine the boundary conditions that make up the left, middle, and right parts of the interval, after intersecting with the current range. There may be no intersection, in which case only the `left` or `right` portion will be available.\n",
    "  - If we have a `left` or `right` portion, then these are not intersecting with the current range.  So add these to our `temp_intervals`, and we can test them with the next range.\n",
    "  - If we have a `mid` portion, then this portion is intersecting with the current range. If so, we need to _shift_ the range to obtain the new range, using exactly the same logic as we used for shifting individual values in Part 1. Note: once we've mapped an interval portion like this, that portion will not be mapped again by this GardinerMap.\n",
    "  - Now, at the end of the loop for this interval, continue to the next loop iteration, which will process the next interval with this range.\n",
    "  - Once we've processed all intervals for this range, re-populate `src_intervals` using the current intervals stored in `temp_intervals`. This allows us to test these intervals with the next range.\n",
    "  - Any intervals that are never mapped with a range will instead be passed on, as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in our `solve_part2()` method, we iterate over all the `GardinerMap` instances, just as we did with Part 1. But this time, we're passing in the seed intervals into the `map_intervals` method of the first `GardinerMap`. This returns a new list of intervals, which we pass into the next `GardinerMap`. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we've left with the intervals generated by the _humidity-to-location_ map. This is a list of tuples, with each tuple containin the start and end values for that interval. So it's a trival matter to get the `min` of all the `start` values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rules for determining hand strengh:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usual poker hand strengths, i.e.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  5-of-a-kind > 4-of-a-kind\n",
    "              > full-house\n",
    "              > 3-of-a-kind\n",
    "              > two pair\n",
    "              > one pair\n",
    "              > high card\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- But unlike normal poker, hand strength tie-breakers are achieved by comparing the successive card strengths of cards in the hand, starting from first to last.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `Hand` class:\n",
    "  - In this class, create a dict class attribute to store `card_scores`. I've assigned integer values so we can compare card strength.\n",
    "  - Create a dict class attribute to store `HAND_TYPE`. Again, I've assigned integer values so that we can compare hands.\n",
    "  - Initialise with a string that represents our five cards.\n",
    "  - I'm using the Python `collections.Counter` class to help me determine the `HAND_TYPE`. The `Counter` class counts members of any collection passed to it, including strings. It stores the counts as a dict, in the form `{character: count}`. Then we can use `most_common()` to convert this dict into an ordered list of tuples, ordered by count.\n",
    "  - From here, it's trivial to determine the hand type.  For example, if `most_common()` count is 5, then we have five-of-a-kind.  If it's 4, then we have four-of-a-kind, and so on. Once we've determined the hand type, store it in the `self._hand_type` instance variable.\n",
    "  - Lastly, I need to be able compare one `Hand` to another, according to the rules above. In Python, we can do this by implementing the `__lt__()` (_less than_) method. Here, my `__lt__()` works by first comparing the values of the hand types. If the two hands have the same type, it then compares the cards in each hand, from left to right. Note that I'm using the cool [zip](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/zip) function to combine the two hands into a single iterable of tuples. This is a cool way to compare _items from thing1_ to _items from thing2_, where the two _things_ are the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now I read the input. For each line, I create a new `Hand` instance, and bid integer. I store these two values as a tuple, and add it to a list of `hands_and_bids`.\n",
    "- Then I sort the hands.  This is easy to do with `sorted()`, because of the work we already did in the `Hand` class. But because I want to sort the tuples of `(hand, bid)`, not just the hands, I need to tell the `sorted()` function that it should sort based on the first item in each tuple. \n",
    "  - This is easily done with a [lambda function](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/functions#lambda-functions): \\\n",
    "  `hands_and_bids = sorted(hands_and_bids, key=lambda x: x[0])`\n",
    "  - The `key` needs to be a function. Here, that function is simply returning the first item in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once sorted, it's easy to loop through my hands from weakest to strongest, and multiply the rank by the bid amount.\n",

    "\n",
    "I used to _really_ hate [recursion](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/recursion). But, having been forced to use it a bit in previous AoCs, I now simply _dislike_ recursion. I don't dislike the _idea_ of it. I dislike the fact that my tiny brain seems to struggle with exactly what needs to be returned for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhoo... This problem is just begging for recursion!  If we were only ever seeing first-order and second-order progressions, then we could use simple math to work out the _n_ th term. But it was my guess that the real input could go pretty deep. So we need to be able to keep recursing to the next set of differences, until the differences remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[NumPy](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/numpy)** for the win!! NumPy has built in capabilities to determine the differences between values in an array, and return these differences as a new array!  This saves me a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here's my approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, I parse the input data. I convert each line into a `list` of `int`. I.e. each list represents our _sequence_.\n",
    "- Then, for each _sequence_, I convert it to a one dimension NumPy ndarray and pass to my `recurse_diffs()` function. Note that I'm using a [list comprehension](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/comprehensions) to do all of this, for each _sequence_. As a result, my `solve()` function is short, neat, and _Pythonic_.\n",
    "- Now, my recursive function, `recurse_diffs()`:\n",
    "  - Here, I first use the NumPy method `diff()` to return all the differences between terms, as a new `ndarray`.\n",
    "  - Then I use `np.all(diffs == diffs[0])` to check if _all_ the values in this _diffs_ array are equal to the value of the first term in the array.  If so, then we've reached the point where the _diffs_ are constant.\n",
    "  - If not, then we recursively call this same function, but passing in the current set of _diffs_ as the new sequence.\n",
    "  - When we've reached the level of nesting where the diffs are constant, we add this diff to the current sequence of diffs, and use this to determine the next value in the diffs sequence.\n",
    "  - Then we bubble this same approach all the way back to the top. I.e. for each level of diffs, we obtain the next diff. And finally, at the very top, this gives us the next value in our sequence.\n"

    "**How many tiles are enclosed by the loop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "OMG. This was pretty tough for me.\n",

    "We're given a sample loop which contains pockets of _inside_ tiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "...........\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's look at this same map, using the visualisation from Part 1. This makes it easy to see which tiles are _inside_ and which tiles are _outside_:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Finding loops, sample data](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/finding_loops_sample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The big challenge is that our pipe loop can have pipes adjacent to each other, forming pockets. Furthermore, our adjacent pipes might form a pocket with a channel to the outside.  So, in the next example, the channel to the outside is now made up of adjacent pipes.  But it _still counts_ as a channel to the outside:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",

    ".S------7.\n",
    ".|F----7|.\n",
    ".||OOOO||.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the central pocket has tiles labelled as _outside_ (O), because they have a channel to the outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Adjacent channels](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/finding_loops_sample_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which pockets are inside or outside is tricky!\n",
    "\n",
    "**My solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by taking the `came_from` breadcrumbs dict from Part 1, and converting it into a complete path of Points that make up our loop.\n",
    "  - Using the dict from farthest point out to starting point, I build a path of one half of the loop. Remember, the dict maps each point to its predecessor; it only goes one way so we have to go from furthest, and move all the way back to the start.\n",
    "  - But I still need to determine the path through the other half of the loop. I do this by determining: the _neighbour_ of the point that is furthest out, that is also part of our overall loop, that is not in the `first_half` path that we've already created, and which is also a valid move from the point that is furthest out. This gives me the _other_ point that is connected to the furthest out point in our loop.  And from here, I can now build a path from this point back to the start.\n",
    "  - Then I join these two paths together, thus creating the closed loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I determine all the _regions_ (pockets) i.e. contiguous points of tiles. \n",
    "- These are pockets of tiles that are either _inside_ or _outside_.\n",
    "- Again, I do this with a BFS _floodfill_, for all points that are not part of the main loop. \n",
    "- We expand a given point until we've fully flood-filled its associated region. Of course, each time we flood fill from a point, we eliminate a bunch of points that we need to flood fill form.\n",
    "- Interesting observation: I pass my main loop to my `get_tile_regions()` function in the form of a `list[Point]`. During our flood fill, we have to check if we've reached a point in the loop. However, it took minutes when I used a list. If I converted by loop points to a `set`, it **runs in seconds**!  Which just goes to show how much more efficient Python is at checking whether something is a member of `set`, vs checking membership of a `list`.`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I return these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each region, I can now arbitrarily pick any point in that region and see if that point is enclosed by the main loop. In the end, I cheated a little, and made use of `matplotlib` `contains_points()` to determine which regions are contained by the loop. Where any region has any point that is contained by the loop, we can conclude that all the points that region are contained by the loop. So we can add all these points to the list of included points.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "I decied to plot the loops and _internal_ tiles. It's an interesting example of superimposing a scatter graph on a line graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    plt.plot(loop_x_values, loop_y_values, \n",
    "             marker='o', linestyle='-', color=\"blue\", label=\"Loop\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "    plt.scatter(inside_x_values, inside_y_values, \n",
    "                marker='x', color=\"red\", label=\"Inside\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one of the sample grids:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Finding loops, sample data](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/contained_points.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And with real data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Finding loops, real data](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/assets/images/contained_points_real.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Remarks and Useful Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of other ways to solve this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One approach is to use the **[non-zero winding rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule)** to determine whether a point falls within an enclosed curve.\n",
    "- This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18fgddy/2023_day_10_part_2_using_a_rendering_algorithm_to/) from `tomi901` provides a **nice visual** to explain how to determine whether a point is in or out.\n",
    "- One more option: you can **scale-up the entire grid by 3**. Every square is replaced by a 3x3 group of squares. The result is that loops that were adjacent now have a channel between them. This allows you to always flood fill to the outside, which makes elimination of _external_ tiles much easier."

    "\n",
    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find all substitutions for `?` that result in valid records.\n",
    "\n",
    "After parsing each row, I store the record in my `SpringRecord` [dataclass](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/classes#dataclass). The count of possible valid arrangements is calculated by the [recursive](https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/python/recursion) `get_arrangements_count()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method systematicalThe damaged_groups tuple defines the required lengths of contiguous blocks of #.\n",
    "The current group index indicates which group (block of #) you are currently trying to complete.\n",

For example, if you are working on the second group, the function knows to compare the current length of contiguous # characters with the second element in damaged_groups.ly explores every possible combination of `.`. and `#` for each `?` in the record. It keeps track of the current state (current character index, current group index, and length of the current group) to ensure the arrangement adheres to the constraints of `damaged_groups`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works like this:\n",
    "- `char_idx` stores the current position in the record string. At each step, we decide what the character at this position could be (`#` or `.`).\n",
    "- The `damaged_groups` tuple defines the required lengths of contiguous blocks of `#`. The current group index (`curr_group_idx`) indicates which group (block of `#`) we are currently trying to complete.\n",
    "- `curr_group_len` keeps track of how many `#` characters have been consecutively placed in the current group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these three pieces of information provide a complete snapshot of our progress through the string at any given recursion level. We know exactly where we are in the string, which group we are trying to fill, and how much of that group we have filled so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base case**\n",
    "  - When `char_idx` equals the length of the record, it means we've reached the end of the record.\n",
    "  - If `curr_group_idx` equals the length of `damaged_groups` and `curr_group_len` is `0`, all groups have been completed correctly, and this arrangement is valid.\n",
    "  - If `curr_group_idx` is the last group and `curr_group_len` equals the length of this last group, this is also a valid arrangement.\n",
    "  - In all other cases, the arrangement is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursion**\n",
    "  - The function iterates over each character (using `char_idx`) in the record. For each character position, it considers both possible states (`.` and `#`).\n",
    "  - We check if the character at `char_idx` in the record is either the same as the state being considered, or a `?`. I.e. because if the current character in the record is a `.`, then `.` is the only valid `char` to try. If the current character in the record is a `#`, then `#` is the only valid `char` to try. If the current character in the record is a `?`, then we can try substituting either `.` or `#`. Thus, whenever we encoutner `?`, our recursion branches into two paths.\n",
    "  - If the considered state is `.`, then there are two cases: 1) `curr_group_len` is `0`, which means we are  not currently counting a group of `#`, so we can safely proceed to the next character. And 2) `curr_group_len` equals the length of the current group in `damaged_groups`, meaning we've completed a group and can proceed to the next group.\n",
    "  - If the considered state is `#`, then we're extending (or beginning) the current group. We increment `curr_group_len` and proceed to the next character.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Why store only these three state values, rather than the entire arrangement string?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Storing the entire arrangement string at each step of the recursion would significantly increase the solution space requirement. For a string of length `n`, there would potentially be 2**n different arrangements (each `?` can be either `#` or `.`), and each arrangement would need to be stored in memory. For larger strings, this just gets too big. (And would not work for Part 2, when we get to it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Instead, this approach stores just three integer values, which is sufficient to continue the recursion without storing the entire arrangement. It's important to understand that the state values (current character index, current group index, and length of the current group) do not represent a complete arrangement in themselves. Instead, they represent a _state_ within the process of building an arrangement. \n",

    "**My solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through each `SpringRecord` we created before, and replicate the two fields as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For the `damaged_groups`, we can simply multiply them by 5 to create the new tuple. Python is clever like that!\n",
    "  - For the `record` strings, we have to first convert each string to a `list` containing our string. Then we can multiply the list five times to result in a list with five members. Then we can use Python's `join()` method, to join the five string members together, putting `?` in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, we can run the same code as for Part 1, but with a couple of tweaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - I've added @cache to the `get_arrangements_count()` method.  This caches any results for any states that we have seen before. And this means that for every recursion, we will have cached all the states that led to this recursion. Because our state is minimal (there are far fewer combinations of [char position, group number, group length] than there are of [record combinations]), this means we can effectively cache each state with each recursed arrangement count.\n",
    "  - To make this work, I have to ensure that my _state_ is _hashable_. I.e. this means that all the parameters I pass to the `get_arrangements_count()` method must themselves be hashable. In my original Part 1, my `SpringRecord` class was not hashable, because my class was mutable. I fixed this by 1) changing my `damaged_groups` from a `list` to a `tuple`, and 2) by adding `(frozen=True)` to my `@dataclass` decorator. This is sufficient to make my `SpringRecord` hashable."
